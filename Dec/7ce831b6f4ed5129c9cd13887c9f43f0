 NGOZI OKORIE GOVERNOR Okezie Ikpeazu of Abia State has suspended his Chief of Staff, Anthony Agbazuere. The CoS’ suspension, which was announced in a statement on Sunday, followed the outrage over an online video, which showed Agbazuere spraying money on an Onitsha-based Prophet Chukwuemeka Ohanaemere in his office. The statement, signed by the Secretary to the State Government, Chris Ezem, said the suspension was with immediate effect. ”Abia State Governor, Dr Okezie Ikpeazu, has directed the immediate suspension from office of the Chief of Staff to the Governor, Dr ACB Agbazuere,” it said. The suspension was announced a few hours after the video went online. In the video, the Prophet, who is the leader of Mountain of Holy Ghost Intervention Deliverance Ministry, was seen dancing as the CoS sprayed money on him.
