 BY LINUS CHIBUIKE MEMBERS of the House of Representatives have finally invited President Muhammadu Buhari to explain the worsening security situation in Nigeria. The lawmakers had earlier disagreed on the motion to invite the President, following which they went into an executive session. When they reconvened, Borno lawmaker, Ahmadu Jaha, who had earlier stressed the need for the invitation which his colleagues from the state had agreed on, was told to move a formal motion for Buhari’s appearance. The motion, which was duly seconded, was subject to a voice vote, and received majority support, which confirmed the invitation of President Buhari to the lower chamber of the National Assembly. No date has however been fixed for his appearance. The Point had earlier reported that the lawmakers might invite the President to explain the security situation in the country, following the gruesome killing of 43 rice farmers by Boko Haram in Borno State. A motion, sponsored by 11 lawmakers from Borno, called for this briefing at Tuesday plenary. The Speaker of the House, Femi Gbajabiamila, disclosed this while speaking on the Borno massacre. “Now is the time to ask difficult questions. We will consider intervention for the people of Zabarmari attacks,” Gbajabiamila had said. The rice farmers had been attacked by the terrorists in Zabarmari Village, in the Jere Local Government of Borno State over the weekend. The assailants had tied up the agricultural workers and slit their throats, according to reports. Nigerians and the international community had condemned the killing in strong terms, while citizens renewed their call for an overhaul of the security architecture of the country.
