 BY ANDREW EKEJIUBA Nigeria international fullback and FC Porto star Zaidu Sanusi has won his first silverware with the club by clinching a record-extending 22nd Supertaca Candido de Oliveira after beating SL Benfica 2-0 at the Estádio Do Dragão on Wednesday night. Sanusi transferred to Porto from Santa Clara in August 2020. One of the first names on manager Sérgio Conceiçao’s team sheet following the transfer of Alex Telles to Manchester United was Sanusi who put in an impressive 90-minute shift at left-back. Goals from Sérgio Oliveira and Luis Diaz secured the win for Porto who qualified to play in the Super Cup by virtue of winning the Primeira Liga for the 2019-2020 season. Sanusi has made fourteen starts in all competitions for Porto and has seen his stock rise after breaking into the Super Eagles starting XI, with three consecutive starts for the national team before dropping to the bench in the last international of 2020 in Freetown. Porto’s next match comes up against Vitoria Guimaraes on Tuesday, December 29, 2020.
