 BY AGNES NWORIE, ABAKALIKI A woman who was displaced following the Ezza/Eziulo crisis in Ebonyi State, has reportedly hung herself on a mango tree behind her house. The Point learnt that the deceased mother of five was once a successful business woman before the lingering crisis that commenced in 2008, which claimed lives and properties of many natives and non-natives alike in the state. She was said to have lost her husband and all tangible belongings and narrowly escaped the crisis alive with her underaged children. In the quest for better conditions of living, the then young widow, Ifeoma Otubo, was said to have relocated to her father’s house at Umuoghara in Ezza North Local Government Area of the state, where she became a peasant farmer to make ends meet. However, it was learnt that the negative effects of the COVID-19 pandemic and #EndSARS protest, worsened her living conditions, which might have forced her to commit suicide. She had allegedly once attempted suicide shortly after the Ezza/Eziulo crisis and displacement. When contacted, Police Public Relations Officer in Ebonyi State, DSP Loveth Odah, confirmed the report. Odah, who described the incident as unfortunate, conveyed the CP’s heartfelt condolences to the people and urged the IDPs not to lose hope. According to her, the government is working hard to resettle them and better their living conditions. She pointed out that the Ezza/Eziulo crisis had defied many peace processes but assured that the state government was working to resettle the IDPs. “On 20th December 2020 by 4 pm, Christopher Nwuzor from Okposi Umuoghara reported at Ezza North division that his sister, one Ifeoma Otubo, aged 45 years, committed suicide by hanging herself on a bush mango tree behind their house. “The DPO mobilised to the area; the body was brought down and no mark of violence was seen on her.
