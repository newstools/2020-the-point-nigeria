 BY FOLASHADE KEHINDE GOVERNOR Babajide Sanwo-Olu of Lagos State has urged residents to observe prescribed protocols by health authorities in the wake of the second wave of the COVID-19 pandemic, saying the state cannot afford another total lockdown. Sanwo-Olu, who is isolation, having tested positive for the virus, urged Lagosians to embrace the required lifestyle adjustments that would help everyone enter 2021 stronger, healthier, and safer. Lagos, the epicentre of the pandemic in Nigeria was locked down for more than five weeks earlier this year, in a bid to contain the spread of the virus, causing untold economic hardship to individuals and businesses amid huge job losses. The Governor observed, in a statement on Saturday, that residents of Lagos had relaxed their adherence with COVID-19 protocols, which had resulted in the rising cases and casualties. He said, “Yesterday, we issued guidelines to help us in the next phase of our battle with the virus. Lagosians have relaxed and the effects are evident with increasing cases and unfortunate deaths. These guidelines will affect us all but we need to be strong and we need to persevere. “We cannot afford another total lockdown so I enjoin us to keep observing the prescribed protocols and the required lifestyle adjustments that will help us enter 2021 stronger, healthier, and safer.” Thanking Lagosians for their support and prayers while in isolation, Sanwo-Olu added, “I am overwhelmed by your show of love and concern about my health and wellbeing. I must admit that the gesture touched me deeply and reaffirmed our connection to one another as humans. “I acknowledge and thank you very sincerely and pray that none of us will lose our lives to COVID-19, and in any other preventable circumstance. “To families that have lost loved ones to the virus, I pray that God grants you the fortitude to bear the loss.”
