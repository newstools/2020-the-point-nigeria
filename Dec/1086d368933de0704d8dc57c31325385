 TIMOTHY AGBOR, OSOGBO FORMER President Olusegun Obasanjo has said that the people of Owu Kingdom do not steal. Obasanjo made this claim while speaking at the 29th Owu National Convention held at the Palace of Owu Kuta in Osun on Saturday. The Owu sub-ethnicity is a part of the Yoruba people of West Africa. Ago-Owu in Abeokuta is where the Owus are mostly concentrated. Large Owu settlements are however found throughout Yorubaland. According to the former President, any Owu indigene involved in the act of stealing should be investigated. Obasanjo, the Chief Host of the annual event, added that such a person might not be a true son or daughter of the Owu People. The former President called for more unity in Owu land, while advising the Owu people to do more in helping one another. Explaining the rationale behind the convention, Obasanjo, who is also an Owu indigene, said it was for all indigenes of Owu to know one another and develop their land. “Owu People do not steal. If you see any Owu indigene stealing, ask the mother where she brought him from. I want us (Owu indigenes) to be more united. We are doing empowerment and giving out scholarship,” he said. He congratulated the new President of the Royal Union of Owu People, Alhaji Fatai Akinbade and tasked him to unite indigenes and ensure the growth of the people of Owu.
