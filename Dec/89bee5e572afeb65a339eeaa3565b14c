 VICTORIA ONU, ABUJA THE Minister of Transport, Rotimi Amaechi, has said travellers using the Lagos-Ibadan railway line will pay a minimum of N3, 000 to use the service. Amaechi made the disclosure on Friday during the inauguration of the Governing Council of the Chartered Institute of Transport Administration of Nigeria in Abuja. The minimum fare for the Lagos Ibadan rail line is in line with the Abuja to Kaduna rail transport minimum charge for travellers. Travellers who use the same route by bus from Ibadan to Lagos pay between N600 to N1,200 to Berger and Oshodi areas in Lagos State. The Minister said, “I have received the mandate of President Muhammadu Buhari to inaugurate the Lagos-Ibadan rail project by January 2021, which will make Nigerians see the way the standard gauge railway looked like. “Today I approved the charges on passengers from Lagos to Ibadan; we just transfer how we charged from Abuja to Kaduna. “We charge N3,000 per Economy seat, N5,000 for Business class and N6,000 for First class; the same is applicable to Lagos to Ibadan. “It should have started running by now before the President inaugurates it by January.”
