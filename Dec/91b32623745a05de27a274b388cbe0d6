 BY TIMOTHY AGBOR, OSOGBO THE Osun State Government has warned schools in the state not to resume until they are told to do so. Specifically, the state government, through the Ministry of Education, said schools would not be reopened in the state on January 4, 2021 as earlier stated. In a public service announcement issued on Thursday and signed by C.k Olaniyan on behalf of the Commissioner for Education in the state, the Government warned that any school that flouts the order would be shut. The statement read, “The Ministry of Education is overwhelmed by the enquires from the Public and Private school owners about the school resumption date as earlier stated in the published School Calendar which puts resumption date at 4th January, 2021. “The Ministry of Education wishes to state in clear terms that the prevailing Public health circumstances, especially those that relate to COVID-19 pandemic has compelled the state to take precautions. “Therefore the Ministry of Education, in conjunction with the Ministry of Health, will come up with the realistic date of school resumption which the Government will consider to determine a new date other than the 4th January, 2021. “Parents are therefore advised to continue to take custody of their children and wards while Private school owners are warned not to reopen under any guise. Contradiction shall attract closure of such schools.”
