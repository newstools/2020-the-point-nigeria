Meanwhile, a bill seeking to establish the Federal College of Nursing and Midwifery, Muchalla in Adamawa state also scaled second reading on Tuesday. Sponsor of the bill, Senator Elisha Ishaku (APC – Adamawa North), said the piece of legislation was “informed by the desire to fill the acute shortfall in qualified healthcare providers for Nigeria’s ever growing population and the imperative to create more access to higher Nursing and Midwifery studies in view of the large number of qualified candidates who are annually stranded in their failed attempt in gaining admission into higher institutions.” The bill after consideration was referred by the Senate President to the Committee on Tertiary Institution and TETFUND for further legislative work.
