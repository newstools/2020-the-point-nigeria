 THE Federal Government has extended registration for the National Identity Number (NIN) by up to six weeks, from Dec. 30 to Feb. 9, 2021, and cancelled the use of Unstructured Supplementary Service Data (USSD) charges for verification across the country. The National Task Force on the NIN and Subscriber Identification Module (SIM) registration made the announcement on Tuesday, in Abuja, in a statement jointly signed by Prof. Umar Danbatta, Executive Vice-Chairman, Nigeria Communications Commission (NCC) and Engr Aliyu Aziz, Director-General, National Identity Management Commission (NIMC). The action followed resolutions adopted at a meeting chaired by Dr Isa Pantami, Minister of Communications and Digital economy. According to the resolutions, there will be  “Three weeks extension for subscribers with NIN, from Dec. 30, 2020 to Jan. 19, 2021. Six weeks extension for subscribers without NIN, from Dec. 30, 2020 to Feb. 9, 2021, while USSD and verification charges remain suspended during these extensions.” Pantami said, “NIMC has provided strategies to enable citizens attend the registration in full compliance with COVID-19 protocols, particularly the use of facemasks, which remains mandatory, and maintenance of social distancing.” He disclosed that President Muhammadu Buhari had commended Nigerians for their patience and commitment to update their Identities and thanked all stakeholders for their compliance with the directives. The President also commended the efforts of the taskforce and urged all stakeholders to take advantage of the extension to link their SIM cards with their NIN, the minister said. – NAN
