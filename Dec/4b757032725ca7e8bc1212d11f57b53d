 BY TIMOTHY AGBOR, OSOGBO A Magistrate’s Court in Osogbo, on Wednesday, granted a coordinator of the second wave of #EndSARS protest in Osun State, Emmanuel Adebisi, bail after 15 days of being in prison. Adebisi was arrested by the Department of State Services for allegedly impersonating the Nigerian Armed Forces. Adebisi was arraigned before the Court by the DSS on a four-count charge bordering on forgery, impersonation, illegal possession of Nigerian Army Uniform, and had since December 14, 2020, been remanded in Ilesha Correctional Center. The presiding Magistrate, Mr Isola Omisade, had declined oral bail application of the defendant, ordering his counsel to apply for his bail formally. However, on December 21, 2020, when the matter was called, Counsel from Ministry of Justice, Barrister Oyedele Akintayo, informed the court that the State was interested in the matter and wished to take over from DSS. The request was granted by the Magistrate and the defendant’s counsel, Mr Niyi Akinsola, moved the formal bail application filed but the State counsel opposed it, stating that the bailiff had not served him with the filed application and urging the court to adjourn the case to enable him to reply to the bail application. The prosecution counsel, Akintayo, and defendant’s counsel, Akinsola, argued on the formal bail application filed before the court on December 23, 2020, and the Magistrate adjourned ruling on bail till Wednesday 30, December 2020. The Magistrate, Mr Isola Omisade, granted bail to Emmanuel Adebisi, known as ‘Captain’ in the sum of N1 million and two sureties. He said one of the sureties must be a level-12 civil servant officer of the state and the other must be a house owner in the state. The magistrate ordered that Adebisi should submit his international passport and should not grant an interview to journalists on any ground. He adjourned the case to January 18, 2020, for mention.
