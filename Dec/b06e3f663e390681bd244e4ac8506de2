 LINUS CHIBUIKE SENIOR Special Assistant to the President on Media and Publicity, Garba Shehu, on Thursday, described as fake, a report that a former Governor of Ogun State, Senator Ibikunle Amosun, transferred N12.5m to President Muhammadu Buhari from the state account when he was governor. He said the money being referred to in the said report (not by The Point), was transferred to the state’s PMB Estate. He made the clarification in a message he posted on social media, noting that the estate in question “is owned by the Ogun State Government, which honoured the President by naming it after him.” According to Garba, those who published the story were only after tarnishing the image of President Buhari. He therefore told the public to ignore the report while stressing that Buhari was a “tried and tested anti-corruption fighter.” “Fake news industry at work. A certain document showing the transfer of N12,500,000 from the coffers of Ogun State to a ‘PMB Estate’ is being circulated to tarnish the image of President Muhammadu Buhari,” he said. Garba added, “The PMB Estate is owned by the Ogun State Government, which honoured the President by naming it after him. Of course, that does not confer the ownership of the estate on President Buhari. “The gossipy online newspaper peddling the falsehood that the President, Muhammadu Buhari, the tried and tested anti-corruption fighter is the beneficiary of this cash transfer should be ignored.”
