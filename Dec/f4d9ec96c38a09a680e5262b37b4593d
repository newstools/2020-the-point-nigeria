 NGOZI OKORIE GOVERNOR Hope Uzodinma of Imo State has sacked the Vice-Chancellor of Imo State University, Owerri, Prof. Victoria Adaobi Obasi. The decision to sack the VC, according to the Governor, was reached at an Executive Council Meeting he chaired. Chief Press Secretary to the Governor, Oguwike Nwachuku, who disclosed the development in a statement, said the VC would vacate his office from December 30, 2020. Obasi is said to be former Governor Rochas Okorocha’s aunt. The statement said, “The government has also okayed December 30, 2020, for the Vice-Chancellor of Imo State University, Prof. Victoria Adaobi Obasi, to stop functioning in that capacity. “The Executive Council of Imo State government gave the approvals on Wednesday, December 16, 2020, insisting that forensic audit of the University’s finances has been necessary if the effort of Governor Hope Uzodimma as the Visitor of Imo State University to reposition the institution must not be a waste.” It added, “While considering the Whitepaper report of the Visitation Panel on IMSU that was headed by Prof. Chinedu Nebo, the Exco also approved December 30, 2020 as date for the end of tenure of Prof. Obasi as the Vice-Chancellor of the Imo State University, “The Executive Council meeting which was presided over by Governor Uzodimma equally approved that henceforth, all admissions into Imo State University, should be strictly on merit and that a Committee to handle all admissions will be set up under the leadership of the Registrar of the University. The idea, the Council noted, is to checkmate the level of admission racketeering in the University as reported by the panel.”
