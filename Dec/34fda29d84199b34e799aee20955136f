 LINUS CHIBUIKE LAWMAKER representing Borno South Senatorial District in the National Assembly, Senator Ali Ndume, said on Friday that he had directed his legal team to begin the process of withdrawing his suretiship for the extradited former Chairman of the defunct Pension Reform Task Team, Abdulrasheed Maina. While commending the Nigerian Police Force for successfully executing the bench warrant issued on Maina by the Federal High Court in Abuja, he said his actions had shown that he was not trustworthy. Ndume also said the development had established the fact that the Nigeria Police Force was not a write-off, under the leadership of the Inspector-General of Police, Mohammed Adamu. He spoke during an interview with journalists in Abuja. “With the successful arrest, extradition and subsequent remand of Maina at the Kuje Correctional Centre, I will proceed to direct my legal team to begin the process of withdrawing my suretiship for Maina with immediate effect because his action has shown that he is not trustworthy,” Ndume said. As part of his bail conditions, the court had ordered Maina to produce a serving senator as surety, and Ndume agreed to stand for him, being the senator representing his district in the Assembly. But the story changed when Maina jumped bail and the court ordered Ndume to appear before it and show cause why he should not forfeit his N500m bail bond. He was later remanded at the Kuje Correctional Centre, following his inability to produce Maina, but released last Friday after a successful defence by his lawyers. “I commend the Nigeria Police Force for executing the bench warrant issued on Maina by the Federal High Court in Abuja. This has shown that the NPF is not a write-off,” Ndume said. “They are professionals under the able leadership of the Inspector General of Police, Mohammed Adamu,” he added.
