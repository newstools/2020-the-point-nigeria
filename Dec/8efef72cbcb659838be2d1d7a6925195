 BY ABUBAKAR ALIDU THE All Progressives Congress (Adamawa State) officially welcomed the Governorship candidate of the African Democratic Congress in the 2019 election, Abdul-Aziz Nyako, and other heavyweight defectors from other political parties, to its fold on Saturday. The party said with the early defection of these prominent Adamawa indigenes, the APC was on the right path to take over governance form the Peoples Democratic Party in the state. Some of those who were officially received into the party, along with Nyako, were a former governor of Adamawa State on the platform of PDP, James Bala Ngillari; Governorship candidate of the Social Democratic Party in 2019, Emmanuel Bello; and Senator representing Adamawa North District, Ishaku Abbo. The defectors were received into the ruling party, along with their supporters. Nyako, who represented Adamawa Central Senatorial District in the 8th Assembly, reportedly collapsed the ADC structure into APC, after merger talks between the two parties. The merger, which would be made official through a ceremony at a later date, became necessary to ensure the end of PDP rule in Adamawa State, The Point learnt.
