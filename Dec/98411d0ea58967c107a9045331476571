 BY ANDREW EKEJIUBA SERIE A giants Napoli are reportedly targeting the Supercoppa Italiana (Italian Super Cup) clash with arch rivals Juventus with the hope that Victor Osimhen who clocked 22 years on Tuesday will be fully fit and firing. The game is expected to take place on 20th January 2021. Osimhen has been out of action since dislocating his shoulder in the Super Eagles’ 4-4 draw with Sierra Leone during an Africa Cup of Nations qualifier last November. With their club-record signing missing, the Neapolitans have suffered three league defeats and they consequently dropped off the pace in the title race. Osimhen should return to action roughly a month after suffering his injury. But his recovery has taken longer than expected. This has included a trip to Belgium for specialist treatment on the shoulder. Reports revealed that Napoli want Osimhen in top shape for the Super Cup clash with Juventus next month. This game is set to have even more spice than usual between the clubs after their Serie A clash scheduled for earlier this season was abandoned. Napoli, feeling they were unable to travel due to Covid-19 restrictions, did not turn up at the Allianz Stadium in Turin. Juve were initially awarded a 3-0 walkover, though a recent appeal means the game will take place at some point in 2021. Meanwhile Osimhen turned on 22 on Tuesday. Napoli, Lille and the Nigeria Football Federation (NFF) were amongst those who joined to the striker‘s birthday. Gennaro Gattuso’s team leads numerous tributes to the Nigeria international forward’s birthday celebration.
