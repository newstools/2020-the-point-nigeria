 BY REBECCA AJANI THE Ekiti State Stakeholders Forum has distanced itself from a call by the state Chapter of the All Progressives Congress for Governor Kayode Fayemi to contest the Presidential election in 2023. The Forum said it was not aware of such move to back Fayemi for Presidency, noting that the statement suggesting this position, which was reported in the media, was a personal view of the state Publicity Secretary of APC, Ade Ajayi, who represented Paul Omotoso at an event in Ekiti. Though the Ekiti APC had not made its stand known in the matter, a statement by ESSF on Monday signed by Bamgboye Adegoroye, said Ajayi expressed a personal view at a social event, where the convener was absent. According to the Forum, all the states in Southern Nigeria deserve a shot at the Presidency depending on what is agreed by the national leadership of the party. The statement said, “The attention of the Ekiti State Stakeholders Forum has been drawn to a statement credited to Mr. Paul Omotoso on the idea that APC Ekiti State chapter has backed Dr. John Kayode Fayemi for the 2023 Presidency. “We want to state unequivocally that Hon. Ade Ajayi who represented Mr. Omotoso barely expressed a personal view at a social event, where the convener was absent or at best, the views of a small clique in the party. “The leaders of APC in Ekiti State are unaware of the idea. Again, we note that Hon. Ade Ajayi’s boss does not even believe that the position should be zoned to South West as expressed on the national platform recently. “Ekiti State Stakeholders Forum along with other eminent Yoruba leaders will canvass for the opportunity to produce the next President in 2023 from our zone. “Adoption of an authentic, qualified, well known, humane and experienced Yoruba man is our goal, and we will play our part in accomplishing that task.”
