 BANYO TEMITAYO SENIOR Special Assistant to President Muhammadu Buhari on Social Media, Lauretta Onochie, has urged Nigerians to remain patriotic and stand by the country’s institutions in spite of current challenges. She also called on those she described as haters of the President and lawmakers not to extend their hatred to Nigeria, citing an example of how Americans protected the integrity of their electoral body in the face of protests by United States President Donald Trump. “If you choose to hate our President and Legislators, it’s okay but that hatred must not be extended to Nigeria and her institutions,” the media aide tweeted. Recall that a heated controversy followed President Buhari’s nomination of Onochie as a national commissioner representing South South in the Independent National Electoral Commission, with critics saying that it was an assault on the 1999 Constitution as amended. “While President Trump is denigrating America’s electoral system, Americans are fiercely defending the integrity of their electoral body; that’s patriotism…We must stand by our institutions as they make progress towards serving us better,” Onochie said in another tweet. The House of Representatives, on Tuesday, summoned the President to explain the worsening security situation in the country, following the outrage over the killing of 43 rice farmers in Borno State, The Point reports. THE Chairman of the Nigeria Governors’ Forum, Kayode Fayemi, in view of the worsening situation, also said that the Nigerian Military was overwhelmed and could no longer single-handedly tackle Nigeria’s security challenges.
