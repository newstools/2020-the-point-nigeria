 LINUS CHIBUIKE FORMER Chairman of the Pension Reform Task Team, Abdulrasheed Maina, who was extradited from Niamey, Niger Republic, on Thursday, appeared before a Federal High Court in Abuja on Friday morning. The former pension boss, whose bail had been revoked for refusing to honour bail conditions, was brought to court for the resumed hearing on his money laundering case by a combined team of operatives of the Economic and Financial Crimes Commission and the Police. He appeared in court, dressed in kaftan and matching cap, guarded by security men. The Point had reported that a Federal High Court in Abuja had commenced Maina’s trial, in absentia. Justice Okon Abang had also, last Monday, ordered that the lawmaker representing Borno South Senatorial District in the National Assembly, Senator Ali Ndume, be remanded in Kuje Correctional Center. He gave the order, following Ndume’s inability to produce Maina, who is standing trial for alleged money laundering to the tune of N2bn. Maina last appeared in court on July 2, 2020, during his legal team’s cross-examination of the sixth prosecution witness. Having failed to attend subsequent proceedings on the matter since September 20, 2020, the Judge revoked the bail earlier granted Maina in a November 18, 2020 ruling, ordered his arrest and ruled that the trial would be done in absentia.
