 FOLASHADE KEHINDE THE Lagos State Traffic Management Agency has returned N52,000 extorted from a lady motorist by a police operative attached to its enforcement unit. General Manager, LATSMA, Olajide Oduyoye, who disclosed this, said when the lady (not identified) contacted the agency, he insisted on investigation, the police operative was identified and the money returned. He said in a series of tweets that the victim’s vehicle was not booked for an offence and that they (security agents and lady) had negotiated the fine from N150,000 to N50,000 for allegedly driving against traffic. The lady in question used a POS for payment, the general manager said. “On Monday, I investigated a case of extortion involving a lady, whose vehicle was arrested wrongfully when the police squad attached to the LASTMA Enforcement Unit went to enforce the law on one-way driving without LASTMA personnel,” he said. “While making arrests, this innocent motorist was also picked up and her vehicle brought to the headquarters. The vehicle was not booked for any offence. They negotiated from N150,000 and ended up fining her N52,000 using a POS for payment,” he added. Oduyoye said she then called the LASTMA contact number and the incident was brought to his notice. He said, “I insisted on investigating the issue, identified the officer involved and the money was retrieved. We called the lady to return to LASTMA Headquarters to collect her money. “She came with her mum and they were extremely grateful. We will be sending a report to the police formation for them to start the process of reprimanding the officer involved. “We will not tolerate any negative attitude from our officers or those attached to any of our enforcement units. We continue to encourage road users to send reports of any errant officer via any of our complaint channels.”
