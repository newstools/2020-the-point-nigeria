 BY LINUS CHIBUIKE CONTRARY to a claim by Governor Aminu Masari of Katsina State that the terrorist group, Boko Haram, was not responsible for the over 300 boys abducted from the Government Science Secondary School, Kankara, last Friday, the dreaded Group has released a video showing some teenagers believed to be the abducted Kankara boys. Some of the boys in the latest video released on Thursday by Boko Haram, appealed to the Federal Government not to use the Army to secure their release, saying they would not be able to help. The boys were looking dirty and terrified. The abductors had stormed the Katsina school on a day President Muhammadu Buhari arrived Daura for a private week-long visit, shooting sporadically. They succeeded in abducting over 300 students of the all-boys school, giving rise to a new coinage of agitation, “BringBackOurBoys”, even as a voice in the video claimed that there were over 500 boys in the forest. Leader of the terrorist group, Abubakar Shekau, claimed responsibility for the crime, despite the fact that Masari said his Government knew where the boys were and had established contact with the abductors. “The report we have and from the information available to us, this abduction was conducted and executed by local bandits that are known to all of us,” Masari had said. The latest six minutes and 30 seconds video, however, casts doubts on this claim. One of the boys in the video was heard saying, “Please help us. Tell the vigilantes and soldiers not to come around…More than 500 of us are in the forest.” He was also heard saying Government should close any form of school, including Islamiyah.
