 BY BANYO TEMITAYO PRESIDENT Muhammadu Buhari, on Tuesday, thanked Nigerians for what he described as their patience in the face of the prevailing economic challenges. The President also appreciated the Organised Labour for its maturity and patriotism, in the midst of these challenges. A statement by the President’s Special Adviser on Media and Publicity, Femi Adesina, quoted Buhari to have expressed his appreciation at the virtual unveiling of the National Gas Expansion Programme and National Auto-gas Roll-out Initiative at the Presidential Villa, Abuja. “Let me now express my deep appreciation to Nigerians for their patience, and organised labour for its maturity and patriotism as we collectively navigate these global economic and other challenges,” the President said. Adesina’s statement, titled, “Economy: President Buhari appreciates Nigerians for patience, urges more use of gas as alternative to petrol”, added that, with a proven reserve of about 203 Trillion Cubic Feet and additional upside of 600 TCF ranking Nigeria as the 9th in the world currently, there was the need for domestic gas expansion and utilisation. According to him, attention should be shifted to more affordable alternative for energy, especially with Nigeria’s heavy reserve. The President was quoted as saying, “Therefore, the roll-out of the National Gas Expansion Programme, Auto-gas initiative is coming at the right time, especially in the light of global crude oil market fluctuations coupled with the full deregulation of the local PMS market. “These developments have made it imperative to focus on gas as an alternative fuel to move Nigeria from the conventional dependence on white products for autos and prime-movers of industrial applications, to cleaner, more available, accessible and affordable energy source.” “The outcome will not only cushion the effect of the downstream deregulation that this government has to painfully implement, but also create new markets and enormous job opportunities for our people,’’ he noted.
