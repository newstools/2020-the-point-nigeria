 ALIYU ABDULLAHI A leader of the terrorist group, Abubakar Shekau, on Tuesday, said, contrary to reports that 43 rice farmers were killed in Kwashebe, Zabarmari, Jere Local Government Area of Borno State, a total of 78 farmers were slaughtered. Claiming responsibility for the gruesome killing in a three-minute video, Shekau said the heinous act was perpetrated in retaliation for the arrest and handing over of one of the Group’s members to the Nigerian Army. He warned those he said were disclosing information about Boko Haram to the authorities to desist, threatening to deal with them like his group dealt with the rice farmers. He said the informants would “face the same fate if they did not desist from doing so.” The sect leader also said those who notoriously nabbed their brethren “and hand them to the military or give them a clue on us. You should know that, unless you repent, what happened to your people is awaiting you.” The rice farmers had been attacked by the terrorists on Saturday. The assailants had tied up the agricultural workers and slit their throats, according to reports. Though the United Nations initially said at least 110 civilians were ruthlessly killed and many others were wounded in the attack, the Federal Government insisted that only 43 farmers were confirmed killed. Shekau’s figure, disclosed in the video he released, is the latest account of casualties in the gruesome attack. Recall that members of the House of Representatives had invited President Muhammadu Buhari to explain the worsening security situation in Nigeria, following a motion by Borno lawmakers in the lower chamber of the National Assembly.
