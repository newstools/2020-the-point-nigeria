 SALIU SALIU THE Katsina State Police Command has confirmed the abduction of hundreds of students from the Government Science Secondary School, Kankara. The Command said the Divisional Police Officer and his men were able to rescue 200 of the students. It, however, said the Police, Nigerian Army, and Nigerian Air Force were working closely with the school authorities to ascertain the actual number of the missing and/or kidnapped students. The Command spoke in a statement on Saturday, shortly after the news of the attack broke. The statement, issued by the Police Public Relations Officer in the state, Sambo Isah, said, “Yesterday, 11/12/2020, at about 21:40hrs, Bandits in their numbers, shooting sporadically with AK 47 rifles, attacked Government Science secondary school, Kankara. “The policemen on duty also responded to the attack and engaged them in a gun duel which gave the students opportunity to scale the fence of the school and run for safety. The DPO reinforced the policemen on duty with Armoured Personnel Carrier, (APC) which forced the hoodlums to retreat back into the forest. “One Inspector sustained a gunshot wound and was taken to the hospital and is responding to treatment. In the course of investigation, the DPO rescued over two hundred students back into the school compound. “The Police, Nigerian Army, and Nigerian Air Force are working closely with the school authorities to ascertain the actual number of the missing and/or kidnapped students while search parties are assidiously working with a view to find and/or rescue the missing students. “It will be too early to say at this particular moment the actual number of students that have been kidnapped or missing.”
