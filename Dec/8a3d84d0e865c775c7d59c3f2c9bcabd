 AYO ESAN THE Northern Governorsâ€™ Forum has welcomed with excitement the release of abducted students of Government Science Secondary School Kankara, Katsina State. Chairman of the Forum and Governor of Plateau State, Simon Lalong, while reacting to the development, commended President Muhammadu Buhari, Governor Aminu Masari, security agencies, community leaders and all stakeholders who contributed in making sure the school boys were released unharmed. Lalong said this while also calling for a full scale investigation into a statement credited to the acting Deputy National Publicity Secretary of the All Progressives Congress, Yekini Nabena, alleging that intelligence reports linked a Governor in one of the North Western States to rising cases of banditry, abductions and other violent crimes in the zone. The Forum maintained that it had no tolerance for such conduct from any of its members. It said it had been working in unison and in conjunction with the Federal Government and security agencies to bring to an end all forms of insecurity and criminal activities in the region and the nation as a whole. On the release of the students, Lalong said it would comfort and assuage the parents and the entire country which had been agonised since the children were kidnapped. According to him, with the release of the students, further measures must be put in place to ensure that this ugly incident does not occur again while thorough investigation should also carried out to ensure that those behind this condemnable act are made to face justice.
