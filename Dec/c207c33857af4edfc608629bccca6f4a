 BY FOLASHADE KEHINDE NATIONAL Publicity Secretary of pan-Yoruba group, Afenifere, Yinka Odumakin, on Wednesday, said the National Leader of the All Progressives Congress, Bola Tinubu, was not the leader of the Yoruba people. He however agreed that Tinubu, a former Governor of Lagos State, was a “leader in Yorubaland.” Odumakin spoke on a PUNCH Online interview programme, The Roundtable. He said Afenifere had not endorsed Tinubu, the Ekiti State Governor, Kayode Fayemi, or any non-Yoruba aspirant for the 2023 presidency, the newspaper reported. The Afenifere spokesman also claimed that the Serving Overseer of the Citadel Global Community Church, Pastor Tunde Bakare, still wants to run for president in 2023, adding that the group had not given support to anyone. Bakare had earlier reportedly compared Tinubu to Jephtah in the Bible, saying he fought many battles for the Yoruba and “delivered Lagos State and nearly all the South-West states from the onslaught of the PDP from 1999 to 2007.” Mixed reactions trailed the message, as many wondered why Bakare, who once spoke against Tinubu turned around to praise him. Commenting on Wednesday, Odumakin said those who had the cathedral right to express views on the pulpit should be careful of what they say. “No, there is no doubt that Asiwaju is a leader in Yorubaland but he is not the leader of the Yoruba people,” Odumakin said, adding that “to say Asiwaju has done more for the Yoruba people is debatable.” He further stated, “You will not earn our support because you are a Yoruba man but we will examine what you stand for. “We have not given support to anyone at the moment. We are watching those who are interested in the 2023 presidency including Fayemi, Tinubu, and even Bakare himself and other non-Yoruba people. “Where each candidate stands on the issue of restructuring and federalism will determine who gets our support. “Afenifere is not afraid to state our support for any candidate and any party.”
