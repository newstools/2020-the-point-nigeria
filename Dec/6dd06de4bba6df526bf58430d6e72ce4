 BY VICTORIA ONU, ABUJA NIGERIA’S food inflation index rose again to 18.30 per cent in November, from the 17.38 per cent recorded in October. The Consumer Price Index, driven by the country’s rising food prices, rose to 14.89 per cent from 14.23 per cent recorded in October. The National Bureau of Statistics said this in its November inflation report released on Tuesday. The country’s inflation index has been largely influenced by the closure of land borders since 2019. The NBS said the rise was accelerated by increases in prices of bread and cereals, potatoes, yam and other tubers. Also, the rise in the prices of meat, fish, fruits, vegetables and oils and fats drove the food index. The Bureau said urban inflation rose to 15.47 per cent in November 2020 from 14.81 per cent recorded in October 2020. The NBS noted that rural inflation also increased by 14.33 per cent in November 2020 from 13.68 per cent in October 2020. In a one-year period, Bauchi State recorded the highest inflation rate at 19.67 per cent, Kogi, 19.81 per cent; and Zamfara, 17.30 per cent. On the other hand, Kwara State recorded the lowest headline year-on-year inflation at 12.24 per cent, followed by Delta State with 13.20 per cent, while Abia’s inflation rate was put 13.26 per cent.
