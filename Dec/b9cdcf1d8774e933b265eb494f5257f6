 WILFRED Ndidi has won plaudits for his Man-of-the-Match performance during Leicester City’s 2-0 victory over Tottenham Hotspur in a Premier League clash on Sunday afternoon. The Foxes won the game thanks to a Jamie Vardy penalty and a Toby Alderweireld own goal either side of half time. The Nigeria international’s dominance in central midfield was instrumental to the win as he prevented Tottenham Hotspur’s dangerous duo Harry Kane and Heung-min Son from finding the net. Ndidi made an astonishing nineteen recoveries against Tottenham, a record for a Premier League game in 2020, according to the statistics. The Leicester City number 25 took to social media to celebrate the win and a clean sheet shortly after the game at the Tottenham Hotspur Stadium. He said on Instagram : “Amazing feeling to get 3 points and a clean sheet away from home”. Reacting to Ndidi’s post, Leicester City right-back James Justin said: “brick wall”. Prior to Sunday’s victory, Leicester City had conceded eleven goals in their last three visits to Tottenham since Ndidi was signed from Racing Genk in January 2017.
