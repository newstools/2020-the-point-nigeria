 BY NGOZI OKORIE EMEKA Ojukwu, son of the late Ikemba Nnewi, Chukwuemeka Odumegwu-Ojukwu, has launched his ambition to become the Governor of Anambra State in 2021. He indicated his interest in the governorship seat, on the platform of the All Progressives Grand Alliance, just as he berated his late father’s wife, Bianca, over an interview she granted a national newspaper, where she was quoted to have said that a former Governor of Anambra State, Willie Obiano, could not replace her late husband. Bianca had reportedly said this in reaction to alleged plans to make the former governor the leader of APGA, noting that the late Ojukwu had told her a lot of things about BIAFRA and the war. In the statement he personally signed as APGA Aspirant, Emeka Ojukwu said, “I would have taken a pass on the insinuations, innuendos and outright falsehoods made in the interview. I find it exigent from the perspective of an insider, to present the truth so as to preserve and protect the ideals that my late father and mentor held sacred. “Given his standing by birth, heritage, disposition and calling, Dim Chukwuemeka Odumegwu-Ojukwu never shied away from fully expressing his feelings, observations and apprehensions.” He said, as a matter of fact, his father documented his views concerning Biafra and Nigeria in books and live interviews for ease of reference, noting that any attempt, therefore, to recast or present his views regarding Biafra or Nigeria without proper references should be considered “dead on arrival.” “Claims therefore of what the legend told or did not tell the claimant (Bianca) about Biafra/Nigeria, should be regarded as the views of the said claimant, in pursuit of what, I don’t know,” he declared.
