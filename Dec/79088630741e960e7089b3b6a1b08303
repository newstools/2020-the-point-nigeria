 BY LINUS CHIBUIKE GOVERNOR Nasir El-Rufai of Kaduna State has sacked the Education Secretaries in the 23 Local Government Areas of the state. El-Rufai also sacked the General Manager of the Community and Social Development Agency, and immediately appointed Mrs. Saude Amina Atoyebi as the acting General Manager of the agency. This, he said, was to reinvigorate governance and deepen reforms in the education sector in Kaduna State. The development was disclosed in a statement signed by the Special Adviser on Media and Communications to the Governor, Muyiwa Adekeye, on Tuesday. The statement said Saude would combine her responsibility as the acting GM, with her role as Head of the State Social Investment Office until a new GM is recruited through a competitive, advertised process. “The most senior official in the Education Department of each LGA will act as Education Secretary until substantive appointments are announced,” the statement added. Saude joined the government in 2015 and has served as Senior Special Assistant (Administration) to the Governor. She was appointed in 2019 as State Focal Person on Social Investment. The statement said, “Saude began working for Malam Nasir El-Rufai in 2012 as a researcher for his acclaimed budget series. She served as secretary of the Finance sub-committee of the 2015 Kaduna State Transition Committee before her appointment as the Governor’s Personal Secretary and Senior Special Assistant, Administration. ‘’In these roles, she has provided support for the running of the Governor’s Office and has sometimes covered the duties of the Principal Private Secretary.”
