 LINUS CHIBUIKE A Federal High Court in Abuja has ordered the remand of a former Chairman of the defunct Pension Reform Taskforce Team, Abulrasheed Maina, in the Correctional Center, till the end of his ongoing money laundering trial. Justice Okon Abang gave the order on Friday, following an application by Counsel to the Economic and Financial Crimes Commission, Mohammed Abubakar. “The defendant is already on bench warrant, having jumped bail. So he shall be remanded in correctional centre pending the conclusion of the trial,” Justice Abang ruled. Maina’s new lawyer, Adaji Abel, however, appealed to the judge to adjourn the hearing so that he could prepare adequately for the case. The hearing was consequently adjourned till December 8. Maina, who was extradited from Niamey, Niger Republic, on Thursday, was produced in court on Friday morning. The former pension boss, whose bail had been revoked for refusing to honour bail conditions, was brought to court by a combined team of operatives of the EFCC and the Police. He appeared in court, dressed in kaftan and matching cap, guarded by security men. The Point had reported that a Federal High Court in Abuja had commenced Maina’s trial, in absentia. Justice Okon Abang had also, last Monday, ordered that the lawmaker representing Borno South Senatorial District in the National Assembly, Senator Ali Ndume, be remanded in Kuje Correctional Center. He gave the order, following Ndume’s inability to produce Maina, who is standing trial for alleged money laundering to the tune of N2bn. Maina last appeared in court on July 2, 2020, during his legal team’s cross-examination of the sixth prosecution witness. Having failed to attend subsequent proceedings on the matter since September 20, 2020, the Judge revoked the bail earlier granted Maina in a November 18, 2020 ruling, ordered his arrest and ruled that the trial would be done in absentia.
