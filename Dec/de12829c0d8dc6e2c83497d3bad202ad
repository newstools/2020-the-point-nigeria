 BY BIMPE ADEYEMI HUNDREDS of angry youths, on Monday, stormed the residence of the Chairman of the All Progressives Congress in Benue State, Abba Yaro, over the death of his security guard whose body was found dangling on a tree. The youths were said to have destroyed the house, located around the permanent site of Zone 4 Police Headquarters, along with three vehicles parked in the compound. The security guard, it was learnt, was electrocuted when he was told to trim the branches of a tree which was touching a high voltage cable. Blaming the deceased’s boss for his untimely death, the youths were said to have stormed the house, forced the gate open and vandalised the building. “The youths jumped in before the matter could be addressed. They broke down the gate and destroyed everywhere including the cars. To them, the guard would not have been electrocuted if he was not told to cut that tree,” an eyewitness said. The APC chairman, Yaro, was however thankful to Governor Samuel Ortom of Benue State for wading in promptly by visiting the house personally and nipping the crisis in the bud. He said the ntervention of Ortom and the Police saved his household from attack. The governor also condemned the attack on the Chairman’s house and urged the youths to stop taking the law into their hands everytime there was a crisis.
