 BBC golf commentator Peter Alliss has passed away at the age of 89. The veteran broadcaster – long been considered to be ‘the voice of golf’ – had been hospitalised in September, and news of his death will be greeted with huge sadness throughout the golf world. A father of six, Alliss had been a fine golfer in his own right before turning to broadcasting, winning 31 tournaments and taking part in eight Ryder Cups. He was presented with a Lifetime Achievement award by the World Golf Hall of Fame in 2012. Famed for his style of commentary which often featuring him whispering, he worked on last month’s Masters at Augusta, and was set to enter his 60th year in broadcasting in 2021. Alliss’ family released a statement saying: “It is with great sadness we announce the passing of golfing and broadcast legend Peter Alliss. “Peter was a devoted husband, father and grandfather and his family ask for privacy at this difficult time.” Barbara Slater, director of BBC Sport, said: “Peter was the voice of golf. He was an absolute master of his craft with a unique ability to capture a moment with a magical turn of phrase that no one else could match. “Just last month,  at the incredible age of  89, he was doing what he loved: commentating for the BBC on the Masters Golf. “He transcended his sport as one of the greatest broadcasters of his generation. He will be terribly missed and our thoughts are with his family, friends and colleagues at this very sad time.” Keith Pelley, Chief Executive Officer of the European Tour, added: “We are deeply saddened to hear of the passing of Peter Alliss, truly one of golf’s greats. “Peter made an indelible mark on everything he did in our game, but especially as a player and a broadcaster, and he leaves a remarkable legacy. “Our thoughts are with his wife Jackie and the Alliss family.” – mirror.co.uk
