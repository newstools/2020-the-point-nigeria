 BY REBECCA AJANI THE candidate of the Peoples Democratic Party in the last Ondo State Governorship election, Eyitayo Jegede, has said his party will soon take over governance in the state. Jegede based his optimism on evidence before the election tribunal, saying that the All Progressives Congress was already jittery about losing in court. He lost to Governor Rotimi Akeredolu of the APC. “The APC in the state is jittery and we shall take over soon,” the Senior Advocate of Nigeria said. He spoke in Akure, the Ondo State capital, on Tuesday, during the inauguration of the newly built PDP secretariat. The Secretariat was razed during the #EndSARS protest by suspected hoodlums. The Secretariat was officially opened by Governor Seyi Makinde of Oyo State, who was represented by the National Vice Chairman, PDP Caretaker Committee, Dayo Ogungbenro. The Chairman of PDP in the state, Fatai Adams, urged members to be committed to the party, noting that their contributions to the growth of PDP would, henceforth, determine what they would get from the party in terms of benefits. He was referring to the fact that the new secretariat was single-handedly built by a governorship aspirant of the party in the October election, Godday Erewa. “This is the first time in the history of politics in Nigeria that a single individual, would build a secretariat of a party. Whenever there is anything to be shared or appointments to be made, contributions of would-be beneficiaries would be put into consideration,” he stressed.
