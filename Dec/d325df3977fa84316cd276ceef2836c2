 BY FOLASHADE KEHINDE FOLLOWING what many have described as the worsening insecurity situation in Nigeria, the United States Embassy in Nigeria has warned American citizens against falling victim to “endemic” crime in the country. While noting that “terrorist organisations and individuals, inspired by extremist ideology, exist throughout Nigeria”, the Embassy cautioned against large gatherings. These were contained in a statement published on the website of the US Embassy, titled, “Holiday Security Alert”. The Embassy told American citizens that crime was endemic throughout Nigeria “ranging from petty street crime to carjacking, and crime levels tend to increase during the holidays.” “Shopping centres, airports, hotels, clubs, restaurants, places of worship, transportation hubs, street markets, and other public venues frequented by Westerners are common attack targets,” it added. The statement urged American citizens to be aware of their surroundings, keep a low profile and carry proper identification. It said they should stay alert in public places and locations frequented by tourists/Westerners; review personal security plans; use caution when driving at night and avoid walking after dark.
