 BY AYO ESAN THE Peoples Democratic Party has said that the All Progressives Congress abandoned its much hyped membership drive because Nigerians did not show any interest in the exercise, following what it described as the manifest failure of the APC and President Muhammadu Buhari. The party in a release issued Friday and signed by its National Publicity Secretary, Kola Ologbondiyan, said this was reinforced by the fact that the APC had become defunct and could no longer engage in legitimate political activities “given the collapse of its structures across the federation.” The PDP said, “The APC has already gone down in history as a jinxed party that is synonymous to failure, deceit, falsehood, lies, lawlessness, treasury looting, poverty and hardship, sympathy for terrorists and bandits, mortgaging of our national sovereignty, among other vices, which makes it impossible for any well-meaning Nigerian to seek to identify with it. “Given their impunity and arrogance, nobody wants to join the APC which has become a derelict pirate ship, stranded and doomed in rough waters and only waiting for its final decent into political abyss.” Ologbondiyan said, by abandoning the membership drive, the Governor Bala Mai Buni-led APC national caretaker committee had come to its wit’s end, “having realised that Nigerians, and even their members do not have confidence in his committee or the fizzling party.” He added, “Already, the few well-meaning Nigerians in the APC have become weary of identifying with a failed party. “While the APC awaits its final decent, Nigerians expect President Buhari to commence steps to recover the over N14 trillion stolen by APC leaders, including the N9.6 trillion detailed in the leaked NNPC memo, the over N3 trillion oil revenue scam among others.” The PDP however urged Nigerians to remain calm and continue to rally on its platform in their collective determination to salvage and reposition the nation from the misrule of the APC.
