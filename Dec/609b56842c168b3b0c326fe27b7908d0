 BY LINUS CHIBUIKE DESPITE insinuations that the resolution of the House of Representatives to invite President Muhammadu Buhari to explain the security situation in the country was an exercise in futility, the President has agreed to address the lawmakers. The Speaker of the House, Femi Gbajabiamila, disclosed Buhari’s acceptance of the lawmakers’ invitation to State House Correspondents after a meeting with the President at the Presidential Villa, Abuja. While noting that the President had agreed to address the lawmakers, he, however, did not disclose the date of the briefing, saying it would be made public later. The Point had reported on Tuesday that the House of Representatives finally invited Buhari after an earlier disagreement on a motion to do so. After an executive session, Borno lawmaker, Ahmadu Jaha, who had earlier stressed the need for the invitation which his colleagues from the state had agreed on, was told to move a formal motion for Buhari’s appearance. The motion, which was duly seconded, was subject to a voice vote, and received majority support, which confirmed the invitation of President Buhari to the lower chamber of the National Assembly.
