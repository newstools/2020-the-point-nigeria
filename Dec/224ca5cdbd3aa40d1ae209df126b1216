 BY FOLASHADE KEHINDE WEEKS after the back and forth between the Minister of Information and Culture, Lai Mohammed, and international news platform, CNN, President Muhammadu Buhari has described the coverage of the #EndSARS protest by foreign press as disgusting. The President particularly berated the coverage by CNN and BBC, saying it was not balanced. He made his position known via a tweet on Wednesday. According to Buhari, the foreign press did not pay attention to the prison breaks, policemen that were killed or stations that were razed. “It must be said that foreign press coverage of the ENDSARS violence was not balanced, especially from CNN and BBC. I was disgusted by the coverage, which did not give attention to the policemen that were killed, the stations that were burnt, and prisons that were opened,” the President tweeted. The Information Minister had, in November, berated the CNN for allegedly relying on social media videos for its report on the alleged shooting of #EndSARS protesters at Lekki tollgate, in Lagos, Nigeria, without verifying them, THE POINT had reported. The Government said such report “should earn the CNN a serious sanction for irresponsible reporting.” Mohammed insisted that contrary to the foreign news platform’s report, not a single family had come out to claim that their family member was killed in what he described as a “massacre without bodies.”
