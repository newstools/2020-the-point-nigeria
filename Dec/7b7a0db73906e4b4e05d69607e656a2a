 BY LINUS CHIBUIKE PRESIDENT Muhammadu Buhari has appealed to Nigerians to be patient and fair to his administration in the face of the country’s security, economic and corruption challenges. He said this while also thanking Governor Bello Masari of Katsina State and intelligence agencies on the historic release of 344 schoolboys kidnapped by Boko Haram from a boarding school in Kankara, last Friday. Buhari, who said this in a tweet, noted that the release of the abducted boys was a great relief to the entire country and the international community at large. “I welcome the release of the kidnapped students of Government Science Secondary School, Kankara. “This is a huge relief to the entire country and international community. The entire country is grateful to Governor Masari, the intelligence agencies, the military and the Police. “Our administration is fully aware of the responsibility we have to protect the lives and properties of all Nigerians. “I ask Nigerians to be patient and fair to us as we deal with the challenges of security, the economy, and corruption. We will not relent,” the President tweeted. The boys had been kidnapped from Government Science Secondary School, Kankara, on the day the President arrived Daura, Katsina, for a week-long private visit. Their abduction had drawn criticisms across the globe with many northern States ordering the closure of boarding and other schools for security reasons.
