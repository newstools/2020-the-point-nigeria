 SALIU SALIU ONE of the students of Government Science Secondary School, Kankara, who were released on Thursday night, said, on Friday, that he did not think their abductors were members of the terrorist group, Boko Haram. The schoolboy, who claimed he was the one who spoke in a viral video said to have been released by the leader of the dreaded group, Abubakar Shekau, said “tiny boys with big guns” forced him to talk in the video. He said he did not know who they were but that they compelled him to say they were Boko Haram, gang of Abu Shekau. The boy spoke shortly after Governor Aminu Masari received him and 343 others at the Government House, Katsina. Corroborating Masari’s earlier claim that local bandits and not Boko Haram had been responsible for the schoolboys’ abduction, he said from what he saw and experienced, “they are not Boko Haram.” The schoolboy also stressed that their kidnappers were afraid of what was happening after their abduction, which was the reason they told him to speak in the video and tell the Federal Government to stop sending the jets and Army, otherwise they (students) would be killed. According to him, they suffered a lot in the six days they were held captive, eating only once a day and drinking water twice a day. “We suffered a lot; they beat us morning and night. They only gave us food once in a day and water, twice in a day. Some of those who beat us are just tiny boys with big guns,” he narrated.
