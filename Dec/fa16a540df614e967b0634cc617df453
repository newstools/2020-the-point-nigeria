 BY ABISOYE JOHNSON THE Police in Ogun State have arrested three suspected Internet fraudsters for allegedly gang-raping an 18-year-old girl. The suspects, identified as Tunde Taiwo 22; Damilola Adesina, 20; and Adegoke Amos, 21, were arrested in the Ijebu-Ode area of Ogun State. Police Public Relations Officer in the state, DSP Abimbola Oyeyemi, who disclosed this in a statement on Tuesday, said the suspects were arrested following a report by the victim at the Ilese Divisional Police Headquarters, in Ijebu-Ode. The three men were said to have accosted the victim on her way to Ita Ale. They were said to have forcefully dragged her into their Lexus ES 350, after which they drove off to the Rationwa area, where they took turns to rape her at gunpoint. The PPRO said, on the strength of the report, the DPO Ilese Division, SP Yakubu Bala, mobilised detectives who stormed the hideout of the Yahoo Boys and arrested one of them. According to him, the arrested suspect led the Police to the other two, and they were subsequently arrested. “On interrogation, they confessed to committing the crime and claimed to have believed that the police were no longer working, hence they could do anything they liked, but they were surprised when the police came after them,” he stated. He said the Commissioner of Police, Edward Ajogun, had ordered the immediate transfer of the suspects to the State Criminal Investigation and Intelligence Department for further investigation and prosecution.
