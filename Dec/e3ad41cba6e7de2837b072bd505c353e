 BY BANYO TEMITAYO FOLLOWING the release of the over 300 students kidnapped from the Government Science Secondary School, Kankara, Katsina State, last Friday, Personal Assistant to President Muhammadu Buhari on New Media, Bashir Ahmad, has said some people are not happy about the development. He said on Twitter that the same people who were happy that the school boys were kidnapped were clearly not happy that they had been released. “When those boys were kidnapped, some people were clearly happy, and now are also clearly not happy with their rescue. Nigeria will always win,” Ahmad tweeted. Governor Aminu Masari of Katsina State had confirmed on Thursday night that 344 boys abducted from the Kankara School had been released.
