 BY AGNES NWORIE, ABAKALIKI UNKNOWN gunmen have invaded a church in Okposi Achara, Ohaozara Local Government Area of Ebonyi State, causing confusion and panic among members as they shot the pastor’s wife. The incident brought the church service to an abrupt end, as members who were at the prayer session, when the hoodlums stormed the premises, abandoned their Bibles and other belongings as they scampered for safety. Elders of the church, Power of God Pentecostal Church, however, returned later to help the pastor’s wife, identified as Chinyere Uchechukwu, to a nearby hospital where she was given medical attention. The real mission of the gunmen were not however clear as of the time of filing this report, but sources told The Point that it could be a case of attempted assassination. When contacted, the Police Public Relations Officer in the state, DSP Loveth Odah, confirmed the incident, disclosing that the Commissioner of Police had ordered full investigation into the circumstances surrounding the shooting. She said, “Investigation is ongoing, the Commissioner of Police is very interested in this matter. He has ordered full investigation into this matter with a view to unravelling the mystery behind the shooting, because, we are actually aware that there is a cult clash in Ebonyi and the joint security operatives are on the matter. We hope, very soon, we will be able to fish out those suspects. “But it is very surprising that the pastor’s wife was shot in the church and nothing was stolen to say it is a case of robbery. And no other person was injured to say it is a mistake of identity.” “The CP has directed that investigation should be strict. The matter has been transferred to state CID,” the PPRO added, while assuring that the perpetrators would be brought to book.
