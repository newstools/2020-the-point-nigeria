 BY LINUS CHIBUIKE MANY Boko Haram terrorists have been killed at the ‘S’ Region in the heart of the Sambisa Forest, in Borno State, in an air strike, which was executed employing a force package of the Nigerian Air Force fighter jets. The insurgents have, in recent times, scaled up their activities in parts of Adamawa and Borno states. The airstrike was said to have been carried out after series of Intelligence, Surveillance and Reconnaissance (ISR) missions revealed that the terrorists responsible for recent attacks in the Southern part of Borno and Northern part of Adamawa State had originated from the location. This was disclosed in a statement by the Coordinator, Defence Media Operations, Major General John Enenche. He said, “Air interdiction missions being conducted by the Air Task Force of Operation LAFIYA DOLE have continued to deal decisive blows on terrorist elements in the North East of the country. “The latest of these was achieved yesterday, 28 December 2020, at the ‘S’ Region in the heart of the Sambisa Forest in Borno State. “The air strike, which was executed employing a force package of Nigerian Air Force (NAF) fighter jets, was carried out after series of Intelligence; Surveillance and Reconnaissance (ISR) missions revealed that the terrorists responsible for recent attacks in the Southern part of Borno and Northern part of Adamawa State had originated from the location.” “Accordingly, the NAF attack aircraft engaged the target area in successive passes, leading to the destruction of some of their structures and logistics stores, including a suspected anti-aircraft gun station as the terrorists fired at the NAF aircraft. Several insurgents were also neutralised in the process,” he added.
