 JACK Grealish has been banned from driving for nine months and handed a fine of £82,000 after pleading guilty to two offences. The Aston Villa captain was involved in two separate incidents in March and October of this year. He arrived at Birmingham Magistrates’ Court shortly after 9.30am on Tuesday ahead of his sentencing hearing, after previously admitting two counts of careless driving. The 25-year-old walked into court after his Range Rover had pulled up outside the main entrance in front of waiting photographers and camera crews, briefly distracting the media’s attention from the footballer – who arrived, separately, on foot. The England international crashed his Range Rover into three parked vehicles in Solihull on March 29, mirror.co.uk reports. The England international crashed his Range Rover into three parked vehicles in Solihull on March 29. The court was shown CCTV footage of Grealish’s Range Rover clipping a parked car and then veering into a wall in Mereways, Dickens Heath, in March. Grealish, wearing a hoodie, was then seen holding his head in his hands, as he approached by-standers. And on October 18 Grealish landed himself in trouble again, with the 25-year-old said to have been travelling at speeds of up to 98mph on a 70mph limit motorway on the M42. Speaking about the first incident, Tinofara Nyatanga, prosecuting, made reference to a witness who observed Grealish. “When he spoke with the defendant, he said he could smell intoxicating liquor on his breath, his speech was slurred, and he was unsteady on his feet,” he said. Less than 24 hours earlier Grealish had posted a Twitter video urging people to stay at home in order to protect the NHS. He later apologised for the crash, saying he was “deeply embarrassed” by the incident. It has been an eventful year for Grealish, whose impressive displays on the pitch have seen him called up to the England team recently. – mirror.co.uk
