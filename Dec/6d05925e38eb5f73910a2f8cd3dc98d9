TIMOTHY AGBOR, OSOGBO NATIONAL Leader of the All Progressives Congress, Bola Tinubu, is currently in a closed-door meeting with key leaders of the party from Osun State. The meeting, sources said, might not be unconnected with the perceived crisis within the Osun APC, arising from an alleged feud between the Minister of Interior, Rauf Aregbesola, and his successor in Osun State, Governor Gboyega Oyetola. Those at the meeting, holding at the Ila Orangun, Osun State residence of a former National Chairman of the party, Bisi Akande, are Aregbesola, Akande, and Oyetola. The intervention, it was learnt, became necessary following the crisis that erupted in the state around the celebration of the Governor’s second year in office. The Interior Minister has however announced his arrival in Osun to commence the stakeholders engagement, in line with President Muhammadu Buhari’s directive to all Federal Executive Council members. “Our entourage paid a courtesy visit to our leader and father, Baba Bisi Akande, alongside Governor of Osun State, Alhaji Adegboyega Oyetola in Ila Orangun. Baba advised us on #EndSARS, insecurity amongst other issues,” he tweeted.
