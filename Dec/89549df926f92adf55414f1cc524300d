 BY NGOZI OKORIE THE apex Igbo socio-cultural group, Ohanaeze Ndigbo, said on Saturday, that the Federal Government had no justification for labeling the Indigenous People of Biafra as a terrorist group when those it claimed were killing innocent Nigerians were walking freely. Ohanaeze advised security agencies to concentrate their efforts on the North East to stop the killings, adding that if other agitators were moving freely in the society without trial and prosecution, it was not right to declare IPOB a terrorist organisation. The Group made reference to bandits and herdsmen who had been kidnapping and killing innocent people in the northern part of Nigeria, without harassment, saying the action against IPOB was one-sided and must be reviewed. President of Ohanaeze in Anambra State, Damian Okeke-Ogene, made these positions known during the organisation’s Executive meeting at the Ohanaeze Secretariat, in Awka. Okeke-Ogene, at the meeting, got the support of the State Executive to contest for the National Office that would be zoned to Anambra State in the Ohanaeze Ndigbo election, scheduled to hold in January. Stressing the group’s position on the issue of terrorism, he asked, “Have you ever heard that IPOB kidnapped, killed anybody unjustly? why would the government go to court within 24 hours after a misunderstanding between Operation Python Dance II of the Nigerian Army and IPOB without a proper investigation and declare the group a terrorist organisation?” “And those with intention of tarnishing the image of the country before the international community are moving freely in the society without any government action,” he claimed. While commending Governor Aminu Masari of Katsina State for ensuring the release of schoolboys abducted from Kankara, Okeke-Ogene called on security agencies to checkmate the activities of immigrants from Niger Republic and Lake Chad.
