 TWO men – Gbenga Adekoya and Abiodun Adesope – were on Tuesday arraigned at an Ikeja Magistrate’s Court in Lagos for allegedly assaulting two policewomen. Adekoya, 34, an apprentice; Adesope, 35, a businessman, who are residents of Ifo in Ogun State, are being tried for alleged conspiracy, breach of peace and assault. According to the Prosecutor, ASP Clifford Ogu, the accused persons committed the offences on December 19 at Ojokoro, Lagos. Ogu said the defendants conspired to assault Insp. Yemisi Olurunfemi and Sgt. Ajoke Ige while they were performing their lawful duties. “The complainants were controlling traffic when the defendants’ vehicle drove against the traffic. They stopped the vehicle, and pleaded with them to reverse and take the right lane. “But instead, the defendants who were passengers, jumped down from the vehicle, ordered the complainants to leave the road, saying that Nigerians do not need the police again. “When the complainants refused to comply, the accused descended and started punching them severally all over their bodies. “A police team on patrol, who received a distress call, stormed the scene and arrested the defendants,” he explained. Ogu said that the offences contravened Sections 168, 174 and 411 of the Criminal Law of Lagos State, 2015. The News Agency of Nigeria reports that Section 174 prescribes a three-year jail term for assault while Section 411 prescribes two years for conspiracy. Following their pleas of not guilty, Magistrate (Mrs) S.K. Matepo released the defendants on bail of N50,000 each with one surety each in like sum. Matepo said that the sureties should be gainfully employed and show evidence of two years tax payment to the Lagos State Government. The magistrate adjourned the case until Jan. 20, 2021 for further hearing.
