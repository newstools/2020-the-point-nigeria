 ADELEKE ADESANYA TRAVELLERS using the Lagos-Ibadan Expressway have been advised to use alternative routes, owing to an explosion from an accident involving a fuel tanker on Wednesday morning. The incident, our correspondent learnt, occurred around 4am when the fuel tanker collided with another truck and burst into flames. Corridor Commander, Federal Road Safety Corps, DCC Kehinde Hamzat, who confirmed the incident, advised road users to plan their trips in a way that would guarantee their safety by taking alternative routes, noting that the road was totally blocked due to the accident. Hamzat said, “A tanker explosion on Magboro bridge on the outward Lagos section of the expressway which occurred at about 0415hrs (4.15am) in the early hours of today, Wednesday, December 2, 2020, has called for the need to adjust one’s movement for the day. “The fire is still burning as at 0520hrs (5:20) and this means a total standstill situation of vehicular movement along the expresway. Relentless efforts are still being made to extinguish the fire by men of Fire Service backed up by men of other agencies around the scene of the inferno. “We therefore advise the general public to have an adequate planning for their trips for those who cannot cancel their planned journeys.
