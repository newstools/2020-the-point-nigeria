 LINUS CHIBUIKE THE Presidency has warned against what it called recurring threats to the corporate existence of Nigeria, saying the President Muhammadu Buhari administration would not be forced to take decisions against the interest of Nigerians. Referring to those it said were uttering words like “the country will break up”, if certain things were not done, the Presidency reiterated that it would not succumb to threats. Senior Special Assistant to the President on Media and Publicity, Garba Shehu, made this known in a series of tweets on Friday. He tweeted, “The Presidency responds to the recurring threats to the corporate existence of the country with factions giving specific timelines for the President to do one thing or another or else, in their language, “the nation will break up. “This is to warn that such unpatriotic outbursts are both unhelpful and unwarranted as this government will not succumb to threats and take any decision out of pressure at a time when the nation’s full attention is needed to deal with the security challenges facing it at a time of the Covid-19 health crisis. “Repeat: this administration will not take any decision against the interests of 200 million Nigerians, who are the President’s first responsibility under the constitution, out of fear or threats especially in this hour of a health crisis. “The President as an elected leader under this constitution will continue to work with patriotic Nigerians, through and in line with the Parliamentary processes to finding solutions to structural and other impediments to the growth and wellbeing of the nation and its people.”
