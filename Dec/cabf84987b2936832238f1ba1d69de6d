 ANDREW EKEJIUBA NAPOLI sporting director Cristiano Giuntoli has confirmed that Victor Osimhen will not play again this year as he’s still undergoing rehabilitation in Belgium after dislocating his shoulder while on international duty with the Super Eagles on November 13. The Nigeria international will not be able to add to his tally of two goals and eight appearances until at least January 2021, Giuntoli has hinted. Osimhen is presently in Antwerp, Belgium, where he is performing muscle strengthening work to protect the joint and athletic work. “Osimhen is still not well, we are waiting for him at the beginning of 2021. “At what point of the month is he back? We are waiting for him at the beginning of January, I don’t know when he will come back, we will see in what conditions it will be and we will evaluate,” Giuntoli said. The 21-year-old Osimhen has not been involved in the last nine matches played by Napoli since his return to Italy last month.
