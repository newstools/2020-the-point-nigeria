 BY ANDREW EKEJIUBA THE Nigeria Professional Football League (NPFL) derby between Akwa United and Dakkada FC ended goalless on Monday. The rivalry between both side was one of the star games of the 2020/2021 NPFL season that got underway on Sunday. The game was shifted in order to make all logistics available as the game was broadcast live by Nigeria Television Authority (NTA) and NPFL.tv. Akwa United hosted their neighbours at the Nest of Champions in a breathtaking encounter. However, the Promise Keepers will have themselves to blame for not taking their chances. Akwa United’s best chance of the game went the way of substitute Ndifreke Effiong in the second half. The striker got at the end of a well tailored pass from new signing Seth Mayi but couldn’t guide the ball into the back of the net. New signings Seth Mayi, Charles Okafor and Abass Sadick all had great opportunities of scoring on their debut for the Promise Keepers but only saw their efforts not hitting the target. Sampson Gbadebo and Ubong Essien also came close to giving their team the lead but their attempts were well defended by Dakkada FC’s back-line. Christian Ekong and Aniekan Ekpe had the chance to secure all three points for their side towards the end of the game. Christian Ekong rattled the post with a powerful free-kick while Aniekan Ekpe saw his curling free-kick sail over the bar from a good position. The draw means that Dakkada FC have gained a vital away point against Akwa United. It’s the second consecutive visit in which Dakkada FC have held Akwa United to a draw.
