… Hearing fixed for October 15 THE candidate of the All Progressives Congress in the September 19, 2020 governorship election in Edo State, Pastor Osagie Ize-Iyamu, made an appearance at the Federal High Court, Benin, on Tuesday, in relation to an alleged N700 million money laundering case instituted against him by the Economic and Financial Crimes Commission. Five defendants appeared in court, including the APC candidate, in line with a July 7, 2020 court order, which mandated them to appear in person before the court. Justice Mohammed Umar Garba, however, adjourned hearing on the preliminary objection to determine the motion on jurisdiction. The court fixed October 15, 2020, for the hearing on motions and gave the accused persons seven days to file their reply, pending the motions challenging the jurisdiction of the court to try them. In the suit marked FHC/BE21C/2016, the defendants, including a former Deputy Governor of Edo State, Lucky Imasuen, and Efe Erimuoghae-Anthony, are facing eight-count charges of money laundering. Charles Edosomwan (SAN), Counsel to the first defendant, had earlier objected the request by the EFCC counsel to continue the case when the pending motions before the court had yet to be heard. He prayed the court to grant the defendants further seven days to react to the EFCC motion on point of law, in line with the rules of the court. The prosecution counsel, Aroga, and Counsel to the 2nd, 3rd, 4th and 5th defendants in the case, did not oppose Edosomwan’s application. He however, raised objection over attempts by the defendants to delay a hearing on the case unnecessarily. Pascal Ugbomen, counsel to the 3rd defendant, said, “The trial judge also granted the preliminary motion which was raised by the counsels to the defendants in the trial. “EFCC is saying that they have jurisdiction, but we challenged the jurisdiction of the court to hear the matter.”
