GOVERNOR Bala Mohammed of Bauchi State has berated the former Speaker of the House of Representatives, Yakubu Dogara, who recently defected from the Peoples Democratic Party to the ruling party, over his recent move, saying “he has become a disgrace.” Mohammed, who said the former speaker did not match his record in terms of votes in the last election, also accused him of inflating contracts with regard to his constituency project. The governor, who spoke when he received a large number of his supporters from the Dass, Tafawa Balewa and Bogoro Local Government Areas, where Dogara represents, at the Government House, on Tuesday, also described the former speaker as an epidemic in politics. Mohammed said, “Besides the Bauchi LGA, there is no place that gave me many votes like Dass, Tafawa Balewa and Bogoro and in the past; these same votes were given to me at the time I contested under the ANPP. The votes I got then were 20 times more than those of Dogara. “Now, that I contested the governorship, the votes I got were also more than his votes as member. Because of that, whatever I will do for you, I won’t do it because of Dogara, I will do it because of God and because of myself.” He added, “Those lies he said about me; that we don’t give allocations to the LGAs. Have the LGAs been like this before? Have you not been seeing what we are doing there? Was it not Dogara that brought the road project from his pocket from Bogoro-Dull-Burga at N17bn, and it has not been completed, and it is just 45 kilometres? “He is just talking because if you see a dog running, it is either it is running to get something or something is chasing it. We pity him because he has become an epidemic in politics… He has become a disgrace. We only depend on God. You (Dogara) are nobody.”
