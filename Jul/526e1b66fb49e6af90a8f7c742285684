The resumption of Port Harcourt and Owerri routes will be announced later, according to the airline. The Chief Operating Officer of Dana Air, Obi Mbanuzuo, said, ” Dana Air is ready to fly safely again from the 9th of July. We have worked round the clock with the NCAA to achieve this safe resumption of flights and we are introducing other initiatives soon in line with the present realities and the need to minimize contacts at the airport. “We have disinfected all our aircraft, provided all our staff with the recommended Personal Protective Equipment (PPE), alcohol-based hand sanitizers have been made available at our check-in, boarding gates and onboard the aircraft for guests and we have an optimized cleaning protocol in place as recommended by the World Health Organisation, (WHO),and the Nigerian Civil Aviation Authority (NCAA)” According to him, Dana has also created a boarding strategy which will give passengers “some sense of safety onboard our aircraft.” Meanwhile Aero Contractors has debunked reports that it was denied approval to fly, saying it only chose to begin operations on Thursday to ensure compliance with COVID-19 protocols.
