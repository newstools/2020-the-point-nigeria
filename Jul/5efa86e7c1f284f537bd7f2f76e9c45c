The Osun State Enforcement Team on COVID-19, on Tuesday, stormed the ancient city of Ilesa and its environs to enforce the one-week lockdown ordered by the state government to contain the community transmission of the deadly Coronavirus pandemic within the axis. The team, alongside officers of the Osun Joint Task Force and Osun Joint Security Network, comprising the Police, Nigeria Civil Defence Corps, Department of State Services, Nigerian Army and Volunteers of Amotekun Corps, took to the major streets and communities in the affected areas and mounted road blocks strategically to prevent vehicular and needless movements of residents. The state government had, last Saturday, ordered a total lockdown of Ilesa West, Ilesa East, Atakumosa East and Atakunmosa West, as part of efforts to contain the disease. The affected four councils are parts of the six local government areas that make up Ijesa-South and Ijesa-North Federal Constituencies of the Osun East Senatorial District. Assessing the level of compliance, the team, led by the Commissioner for Local Government and Chieftaincy Affairs, Hon. Adebayo Adeleke, commended residents for observing the lockdown directive. Recall that the Commissioner for Health in the state, Dr. Rafiu Isamotu, while speaking recently, noted that medical analysis revealed that many of the recent cases of COVID-19 recorded in the state were from Ilesa axis and its environs, hence the need for government to impose a total lockdown to curb community transmission of the pandemic.
