The Edo State Peoples Democratic Party Campaign Council has lambasted the All Progressives Congress’ candidate in the Edo governorship election, Osagie Ize-Iyamu, over allegations that his much-hyped “Simple Agenda” was copied from another Edo State governorship aspirant in 2015. The Campaign Council also called on the Inspector General of Police to commence an investigation into what it described as a “very weighty allegation against the APC governorship candidate.” In a release issued by the Edo State PDP Campaign Council, and signed by its Publicity Secretary, Chris Nehikhare, the party said, “It is unfortunate that the APC candidate has become a butt of public ridicule, following the emergence of a video interview wherein another Edo State governorship aspirant in 2015, Don Pedro Obaseki, unveiled the same SIMPLE agenda document as his campaign manifesto in that election. “This embarrassing development has not only further shown that the APC and its candidate have no agenda for Edo State, but also highlights the allegations by the former National Chairman of the APC, Adams Oshiomhole, that the APC candidate is a person of questionable character who cannot be trusted with the position of the governor of Edo State.” The party charged Ize-Iyamu to immediately speak out on the allegation, noting that plagiarism was a serious criminal offence for which culprits must be prosecuted according to the law. “This is because any individual aspiring for the position of a state governor must live above board and be seen as so in the eyes of the voting population. In this regard, we urge the Inspector General of Police to commence an investigation into this very weighty allegation against the APC governorship  candidate,” the campaign council said.
