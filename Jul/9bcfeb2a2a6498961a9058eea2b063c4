A former Commissioner for Information and member of the Peoples Democratic Party in Edo State, Kassim Afegbua, has faulted the PDP Primary that produced the Governor of the state, Godwin Obaseki, as the party’s candidate in the September 19 election. Afegbua vowed that he would not support Obaseki for the second term in office. “At least, I am bold enough to come out in the open and say that I will not support Obaseki. It would have been different if I was hiding or pretending to be supporting him and doing some damages,” he said. When asked if he would work against Obaseki, being the PDP candidate in the forthcoming polls, Afegbua neither affirmed nor denied it. He noted that his position on the governor was not borne out of greed, resentment or hatred, calling on some processes in democratic governance to be followed. The former PDP spokesman in the 2019 presidential election is apparently aggrieved at how Obaseki emerged as his party’s candidate shortly after decamping from the All Progressives Congress. He said, “My position on Obaseki is not borne out of desperation, greed or money politics. My position on Obaseki is borne out of the fact that there has to be a difference in the way and manner that democracy is run in this country. “Someone cannot just join a party within 24 hours, you surrender every whims and caprice of the party to him and then you sit back and tell me that you are celebrating your Christmas early enough in the day.” The Independent National Electoral Commission fixed September 19 for the Edo governorship election.
