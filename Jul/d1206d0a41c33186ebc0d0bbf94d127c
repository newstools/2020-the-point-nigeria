Two boys, aged 14 and 15, have been remanded at the Ebonyi State Juvenile Remand Home, Ugwuachara, for allegedly gang-raping a 14-year-old female in her family house. The 14-year-old female victim (name withheld), who resides at Ikelagu Ishieke community, in Ebonyi Local Government Area of the state, was said to have been raped in her residence. The two boys had reportedly visited her and met her on her way to the bathroom, when all members of her family were not at home. They were said to have forcefully removed the girlâ€™s wrapper and gang-raped her on the 14th of June, 2020, around 1pm. Hope Anemhen Esq held brief for the nominal complainant, International Federation of Women Lawyers. The defendants, Chidiogo Okonkwo and Chidubem Owoh, who had no defence counsels during the arraignment, were arraigned on two-count charges of conspiracy and rape in a suit numbered MAB/311C/ 2020. According to Police Prosecutor, ASP Ezeh N., the offence is punishable under Section 516A(a) of the Criminal Code Cap 33, Volume 1, Laws of Ebonyi State of Nigeria 2009; and Section 34(2) Ebonyi State Child Rights Law and Related Matters 2010. Speaking on the matter, Chief Magistrate Nnenna Onuoha, who was visibly angry about increasing cases of rape and other anomalies in the country, admonished the mothers of the defendants, victim and all mothers in the country to be alive to their motherly responsibilities. She opined that if mothers would devote more of their time to home-front issues, which included taking proper care of their children, the society would be a better place. Consequently, she ordered the remand of the children in the state juvenile remand home, while the case was adjourned to July 29, 2020, for report of compliance. The trial Magistrate also directed that all documents and evidences in the matter be forwarded to the Director of Public Prosecution for further action.
