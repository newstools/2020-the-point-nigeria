As Nigerians mark the 22nd anniversary of the death of the acclaimed winner of the June 12, 1993 presidential election, Chief Moshood Kashimawo Olawole Abiola, two groups – the Women Arise and Kudirat Initiative for Democracy – have called for the restoration of MKO’s political agenda to emancipate the downtrodden and long-suffering Nigerian masses as the true objective of real democracy and true measure of national Independence. In a release issued on Tuesday by the two organisations and signed by the President, Women Arise, Joe Okei-Odumakin; and President of KIND, Hafsat Abiola–Costello, they called on President Muhammadu Buhari and the National Assembly to give a  posthumous recognition of Abiola as President of Nigeria and for his portrait to be displayed amongst those of past Nigerian presidents and Heads of State. The groups also called for a “judicial commission of enquiry to unravel how the high treason of the murder of MKO Abiola was carried out while he was in the custody of the Nigerian state, and the restructuring of Nigeria, which has become the only exercise that can stall and reverse the fragmentation of the country.” They further called on Nigerians, irrespective of creed, race, religious inclination or affiliation, to re-dedicate themselves to the ideals of the struggle for genuine democracy, birthed by credible elections, adding that  entrenching the true spirit of June 12, which is free and fair elections, was the best way to immortalise MKO. “In conclusion, we salute the memory of MKO Abiola, whose election was clean, free and fair and was so adjudged by local and international observers. As we salute the memory of MKO Abiola, we call for an end to political manipulations that have hallmarked most elections before and after that of June 12, 1993,” the statement said.
