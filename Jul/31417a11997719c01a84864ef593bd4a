The new commissioner expressed appreciation to the governor while pledging his loyalty to him. He assured that he would serve as a bridge between the government and the people by informing the people about the achievements and policies of Governor Godwin Obaseki, especially as the state approaches the election. “I will serve as a bridge that will connect the people and Government and put them on the same page.

I will embark on an aggressive information dissemination to the people across the state,” he assured.
