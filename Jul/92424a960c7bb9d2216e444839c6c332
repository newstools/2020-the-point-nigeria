THE Secretary to the Ondo State Government, Ifedayo Abegunde, has resigned. In a letter addressed to Governor Rotimi Akeredolu, dated 6th July, 2020, and sighted by our correspondent, Abegunde thanked him for the opportunity to serve the people of the state but did not give a reason for his action. It is however suspected that Abegunde would also decamp to the opposition Peoples Democratic Party like the Deputy Governor of the state, Agboola Ajayi. The former SSG and Deputy Governor are said to be friends. It was gathered from the depury governorâ€™s camp that Abegunde might reveal his next step today.
