… says Bauchi people’ll not condone ‘political indiscipline’ A Chieftain of the People’s Democratic Party, Bibi Dogo, has asked the House of Representatives to declare the seat of former Speaker, Yakubu Dogara, vacant. Dogo made the call in a statement on Monday, in view of Dogara’s defection from the party to the ruling All Progressives Congress on Friday. Dogo described Dogara’s defection as political indiscipline, saying that the people of Bauch State, who had elected him were not happy with the move and would have to elect a capable representative. He noted that the former Speaker, who represents the Bogoro/Dass/Tafawa Balewa constituency, had no genuine reason for decamping, saying, “There is no convincing reason why he defected to APC. He didn’t even consult his people before his defection. “I hereby call on the Reps leadership to quickly declare Dogara’s seat vacant to enable his constituents to elect a capable replacement.” Dogo said members of Dogara’s constituency would set machinery in motion for his recall very soon because they would not condone what he called political indiscipline. On Dogara’s reasons for decamping, the PDP chieftain said, “They are nothing but flimsy excuses because the alleged mismanaged money is N3.6 billion and not N4.6 billion. Furthermore, the contract was awarded for the purchase of vehicles, which Dogara is a beneficiary of, and it was COVID-19 that delayed the local government elections. “Presently, a date has been fixed by the Bauchi State Independent Electoral Commission which will be conducted in October. And do I need to mention that everybody knows that the governor who comes from a royal family has great respect for our traditional institution? “His jumping from party to party smacks off political indiscipline. Unfortunately, he lacks the political discipline to still be trusted with any public office. How can you trust a man whose only political antecedent is jumping from one party to another?”
