The Nigeria Centre for Disease Control has accredited the Edo Specialist Hospital to join its laboratory network for COVID-19 test. The development comes in the wake of reforms by the Governor Godwin Obaseki-led administration, which had procured three PCR machines to be installed in three hospitals designated for testing in response to the COVID-19 pandemic. Special Adviser to the Edo State Governor on Media and Communication Strategy, Crusoe Osagie, said the feat was commendable and worthwhile, as it had raised the state’s capacity to test for coronavirus and properly manage the spread of the virus in the state. He said, “We have just received news that after necessary vetting and inspection, the Nigeria Centre for Disease Control (NCDC) has accredited Edo Specialist Hospital, Benin to conduct COVID-19 test. This is as a result of the installation of a Polymerase Chain Reaction (PCR) machine at the facility by the Edo State Government in its proactive response to containing the coronavirus pandemic. “You will recall that when the Director-General of the NCDC, Dr. Chikwe Ihekweazu, visited the state, and severally, at the briefing by the Presidential Taskforce on COVID, he had mentioned how Edo State was a leading light in the response to the COVID-19 pandemic.” He said the state government would continue to prioritise the health and safety of the people, which was why it was sparing no resources in facilitating effective and efficient health services to Edo people. The governor’s aide added that the increased number of confirmed COVID-19 cases in the state was as a result of an efficient response system, which allowed for more testing of samples in the state to get a good picture of the spread of the virus.
