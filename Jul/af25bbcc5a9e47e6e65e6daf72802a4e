… as 8 aspirants jostle for ticket, promise to accept outcome Non-party delegates were, on Wednesday, barred from the venue of the Peoples Democratic Party’s primary election. A total of 2,111 delegates will participate in the election. The venue of the primary is the International Culture and Event Centre, the Dome, in Akure, the state capital. Those jostling to fly the flag of the main opposition party, in the October 10, 2020 governorship election in the state, include the Deputy Governor, Agboola Ajayi; Eyitayo Jegede, SAN; Eddy Olafeso; Banji Okunomo; Sola Ebiseni; Bode Ayorinde; Gooday Erewa; and Boluwaji Kunlere. The Caretaker Chairman of the party in the state, Clement Faboyede, had, in a statement warned delegates not to wear any campaign material to the venue, adding that “only delegates, aspirants agents, journalists and security personnel would be allowed into the venue of the primary.” He said, “Only delegates, aspirants agents (3 per aspirant), journalists and security men will be allowed into the venue of the primaries. On no account should any delegate be seen wearing any campaign materials at the venue of the primaries, no member of the party outside the above mentioned are allowed to come to the venue. “There shall be no loitering or gathering allowed around the venue. Anyone who is not a delegate or the above mentioned shall be deemed an intruder and promptly arrested and all delegates should come with their INEC Personal Voters Card (PVC).” To forestall a post-primary party crisis, however, the National Chairman, PDP, Uche Secondus, had agreed with the eight aspirants, through a Memorandum of Understanding, that all others would support the eventual winner of the primary election.
