The Management of the Osun State Polytechnic, Iree, has approved a virtual matriculation exercise for all ND1 Daily Part Time students for the 2019/2020 academic session of the institution. According to a statement signed by the Registrar of the institution, B.M. Salawu, and made available to journalists by the school’s Public Relations Officer, Tope Abiola, on Friday, “all the affected students are to create private Zoom Accounts that they will use to participate in the online Matriculation exercise.” The students, the Registrar said, were expected to pay the approved school fees with their debit cards and complete their course registration, online, before 30th July, 2020. He stressed that any ND 1 student, who refused to pay the school fees and participate in the virtual matriculation exercise, would lose his/her studentship. He added that the date, time and other details of the matriculation would be communicated to the students through their personal contacts and emails. The registrar admonished parents and guardians to ensure that their wards pay the required school fees, open the zoom account and participate actively in the virtual matriculation, so that they would not forfeit the offer of admission.
