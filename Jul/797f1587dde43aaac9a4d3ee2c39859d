THE Redeemed Christian Church of God has relieved an Assistant Pastor of the church, Gideon Bakare, of all ministerial duties. The pastor, who was sacked for embarrassing the Church, was recently accused of attempting to sleep with a married woman in her matrimonial home in Akure, Ondo State Ondo State. A video had gone viral on social media, where the embattled pastor was seen naked with the female church member beside him. The woman who was seen in the video accusing the said pastor of wanting to sleep with her, also threatened to report the accused to his wife, while the pastor continued begging. Her family members were seen recording the scene. The Head, Media, and Public Relations, RCCG, Pastor Olaitan Olubiyi, in a statement on Thursday, said the church dissociated itself from the shameful act. “The church, after reviewing the report of its investigation, noted that by his conduct, Bakare has not only tainted his personal reputation but has portrayed the Church in a bad light. Mr Bakare has therefore been directed to return all official items in his custody and stay off all associated connections with the mission with immediate effect,” Olubiyi said.
