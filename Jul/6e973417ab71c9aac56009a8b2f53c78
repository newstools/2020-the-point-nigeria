THE Director, Obaseki/Shaibu Movement, Patrick Iyoha, has resigned his appointment. Iyoha, who is a member of the state Waste Management Board, said his resignation, which was with immedidate effect, was due to personal reasons. He said this in a letter dated July 28, 2020, addressed to Governor Godwin Obaseki of Edo State. Two other officials – Gabriel Oiboh, the Chairman, Post Primary Education Board, and Osanyemwere Osawe –also resigned from the Government, attributing their decisions to alleged pressure on them to defect to the Peoples Democratic Party. However, Obaseki had refuted claims that he was mounting pressure on government officials to defect to his new party, the PDP, saying that the number of people that had already defected to the PDP was unprecedented. He said the party had to call for more membership cards, owing to rising demand.
