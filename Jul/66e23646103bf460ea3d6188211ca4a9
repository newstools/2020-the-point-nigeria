The Nigerian Investment Promotion Commission has said that the country recorded a total investment commitment of $5.06bn from investors in the first half of this year. The commission said this in a report released on Sunday in Abuja. The report showed that a total of 34 projects, across 16 states and the Federal Capital Territory, were announced by investors from Nigeria and three other countries. Analysis of the report showed that the $5.06bn pledged to be invested into the Nigerian economy represents a decline of $10.09bn, or 67 per cent, when compared to the $15.15bn recorded in the first half of last year. The Commission, in the report, blamed the drop on the negative global economic impact of the coronavirus pandemic. Further analysis of the NIPC report showed that the major investment destinations during the period were Kaduna State ($2.61bn), Lagos State ($221m), Nasarawa State ($56m), Ekiti State ($50m) and Cross River ($15m). Similarly, the top five sectors were transportation and storage, information and communication, mining and quarrying, finance insurance and agriculture. It stated that the United States was the most active source of investments during the period with 43 per cent of the announcements. The other major sources were South Africa (31 per cent), domestic investors (16 per cent), and United Kingdom (eight per cent).
