The Presidency has reacted to the Senate’s call for the removal of service chiefs, saying only President Muhammadu Buhari has the power to appoint or sack them. The Presidency added that, in his capacity as Commander-in-Chief of the Armed Forces, Buhari would act in the best interest of the country in every situation. “The Presidency notes the resolution, and reiterates that appointment or sack of Service Chiefs is a Presidential prerogative, and President Muhammadu Buhari, in his capacity as Commander-in-Chief of the Armed Forces, will do what is in the best interest of the country at all times,” the Special Adviser to the President on Media and Publicity, Femi Adesina, said in a statement on Tuesday. The Senate had, earlier on Tuesday, called on all Service Chiefs to resign to enable lawmakers unravel the reasons behind the incessant killings of soldiers protecting the lives and property of Nigerians. The lawmakers said this had become imperative, following the resignation of over 200 soldiers from the Nigerian Army, recent killing of soldiers, and other related issues that must be thoroughly investigated. The Upper legislative chamber had mandated the joint committees on Army, Navy and Defence, Interior, and Airforce to interface with the concerned heads of security agencies on the issue. The four service chiefs are: Chief of Defence Staff, General Abayomi Olonisakin; Chief of Army Staff, General Tukur Buratai; Chief of Air Staff, Air Marshal Sadique Abubakar; and Chief of Naval Staff, Vice Marshal Ibok- Ete Ibas. The Senate passed the resolution calling for the removal of the service chiefs, based on a motion by former Senate Leader and Chairman, Senate Committee on Army, Senator Ali Ndume, (APC, Borno South). Ndume had also recounted the high level of casualties among military men and other security officers in recent times.
