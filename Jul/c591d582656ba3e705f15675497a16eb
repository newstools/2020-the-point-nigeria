The heavy rainfall, which lasted for a very short period on Saturday, has destroyed the only link bridge between Ojirami Petesh and Afe, both at ward 5 in Akoko Edo Local Government Area of Edo state. The rain, which started at about 6pm, was heavy and stormy, leading to the damage of the bridge, which now made it impossible for the movement of goods, persons and services from the Afe community to Igarra, the headquarters of the council. Ojirami Afe, a community which is basically agrarian, has been devastated with heavy flood. The popular garri market, where traders gather every five days, has also been blocked by the inaccessibility of the market. The people of Afe are therefore calling on the relevant authorities, especially the Council Chairman, Don Oteh Umoru, to come to their aid. They also appealed to their leader, Comrade Peter Ohiozojie Akpatason, to do something to alleviate the sufferings arising from the broken bridge.
