… as 48-hour ultimatum to publish beneficiaries’ names expires THE House of Representatives, on Thursday, resolved to sue the Minister of Niger Delta Affairs, Godswill Akpabio, for alleged perjury and civil defamation. The Speaker of the House, Femi Gbajabiamila, had, on Tuesday, kicked against the minister’s allegation, during a hearing on alleged corruption in the Niger Delta Development Commission, that members of the House were partners in the controversial contracts tied to the probe. Gbajabiamila, in reaction to the allegation, had on Tuesday, given Akpabio 48 hours to name lawmakers who benefitted from the said contracts. This followed Akpabio’s allegation that the lawmakers were the beneficiaries of many of the controversial contracts given out by the NDDC. Since the minister had not complied with the order to publish the names of beneficiary lawmakers at the expiration of the 48-hour ultimatum on Thursday, the Speaker said the House had resolved to head to court. The Speaker said he had told the Clerk of the House to initiate Perjury proceedings against the minister. “At the same time, we will instruct Counsel to explore the possibility of a civil defamation suit,” he said.
