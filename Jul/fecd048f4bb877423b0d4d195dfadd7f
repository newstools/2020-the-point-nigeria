Members of the Ondo State House of Assembly, on Tuesday, served the Deputy Governor of the state, Agboola Ajayi, a notice of impeachment. The notice was signed by 14 out of the 26 legislators. Nine members were said to have however voted against the impeachment. The Deputy Governor and Governor Rotimi Akeredolu have been at loggerheads for weeks. The high point was the defection of the former from the All Progressives Congress to the opposition Peoples Democratic Congress a few days ago. Ajayi had insisted that he would not resign as deputy governor after his defection. Former Secretary to the State Government, Ifedayo Abegunde, also resigned on Monday, and was replaced immediately with former Commissioner of Tourism, Temitayo Oluwatuyi. While the Governor was in isolation, after testing positive for COVID-19, he had also refused to hand over governance to his deputy, citing loyalty issues. He, however, returned fully to work on Monday after testing negative twice for the virus.
