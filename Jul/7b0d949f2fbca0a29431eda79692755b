THE Deputy Governor of Edo State, Philip Shaibu, has tendered an unreserved apology to the members and leaders of the Peoples Democratic Party over what he described as his past deeds against the party during his days as a member of the All Progressives Congress. The Deputy Governor, who was formerly the Edo North leader of the APC, humbly tendered his apology at a unification meeting of the PDP and former APC Leaders, across Edo North, in his country home, in Jattu, Etsako West Local Government. Shaibu, as a demonstration of his atonement, said he had directed his lawyers to withdraw all pending cases instituted against any member of his newly embraced party, PDP. Again, the deputy governor said he was willing to visit any member and leader of the PDP, especially those who were unavoidably absent at the meeting, but who might still be aggrieved, to apologise over his past deeds against them. The meeting, which was well attended and successful in resolving all perceived differences amongst all the leaders of both the PDP, Obaseki solidarity movement and other critical stakeholders, was the first meeting to be presided over by Shaibu since he became the Leader of party in the district. Some PDP leaders present at the meeting are: Tunde Akogun, former Majority Leader, House of Representatives, who led the delegation of PDP leaders from FCT, Abuja. Others are Hajia Umoru Hadiza, Deputy National Woman Leader, Segun Saiki, Jude Imagwe, and Alaba Oshogwemoh.
