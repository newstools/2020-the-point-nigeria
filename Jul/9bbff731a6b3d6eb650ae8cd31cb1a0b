President Muhammadu Buhari, on Saturday, approved the naming of the Railway Complex in Agbor, Delta State, after his predecessor, Goodluck Jonathan. The Special Assistant to the President on Digital and New Media, Tolu Ogunlesi, disclosed this on his Twitter handle on Saturday, quoting the Minister of Transportation, Rotimi Amaechi. ““BREAKING | President @MBuhari has approved the naming of the Railway Complex in Agbor – the operational hub of #ItakpeWarriRail Line – after former President @GEJonathan. It will be known as the Goodluck Jonathan Railway Station & Complex — Minister of Transport @ChibuikeAmaechi,” he tweeted. “Yes, it is good news. But I know Buhari. There is something happening that we don’t know yet. There is a romance between those two that is not comfortable,” a top Peoples Democratic Party leader told our correspondent in confidence. Following the completion of work on the Itakpe-Warri standard gauge rail line by the current administration, a test-run of coaches on the route had commenced on Friday. Amaechi had disclosed this on his Twitter Handle @ChibuikeAmaechi. “Today, we started test-run of the newly delivered coaches on the completed Itakpe-Warrior standard gauge rail line,” he tweeted. The rail line, named after Jonathan, is part of the Lagos-Calabar coastal railway project, which cuts across many states in the South-East and South-South. The project was initiated during the Jonathan administration but was relaunched when the transport minister signed a fresh mandate in 2016. The 276 km rail line links Warrior in Delta and Agenebode (Edo) to Ajaokuta in Kogi State. Work on the rail line started in 1987 under the military administration of General Ibrahim Babangida but was reportedly abandoned by successive administrations, owing to lack of funds.
