… delegates ‘critical tasks’ to deputy GOVERNOR Kayode Fayemi of Ekiti State has tested positive for COVID-19. Fayemi, who is the Chairman of Nigeria Governors Forum, disclosed this on his Twitter handle @kfayemi on Wednesday. The governor tweeted, “I took my third COVID-19 test yesterday and it came back positive. I’m generally ok and I’m already self-isolating at home and receiving the best of care from my medical team. I’m delegating critical tasks to my Deputy but will continue routine duty from home. JFK.” The governor has been very active in efforts to solve the crisis rocking the All Progressives Congress, and would seize the opportunity of the isolation period to have some rest, some Ekiti indigenes have said, while wishing him quick recovery.
