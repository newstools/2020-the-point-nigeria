The newly appointed Caretaker Committee of the All Progressives Congress, led by the Chairman, Governor Mai Mala Buni of Yobe State, visited the National Leader of the party, Bola Tinubu, on Thursday. The visit, which came amidst insinuations that the Presidency and a cabal in the APC might have used the dissolution of the party’s National Working Committee to whittle down Tinubu’s influence, paints a different picture of the whole exercise. The committee, with this visit, affirms that it is on a reconciliation mission. The visit was also to discuss the Edo and Ondo elections, it was gathered. Already, the Caretaker Committee has appointed a 49-member campaign council, led by Governor Abdullahi Ganduje of Kano State, for the Edo State Governorship election. Also present at the Thursday meeting with Tinubu were Governor Babajide Sanwo-Olu of Lagos State, Governor Atiku Bagudu of Kebbi State, and Gboyega Oyetola of Osun States, who are regarded as the APC leader’s loyalists.
