THE Department of State Services said, on Monday, that it had uncovered plans by some persons and groups to destabilise Nigeria. The Department also warned that it was aware of what it described as the evil plans and their sponsors, assuring Nigerians that it would ensure the sinister objective was not achieved. Spokesperson for the DSS, Peter Afunanya, in a statement made available to journalists, said some prominent Nigerians and socio-cultural groups were engaging in divisive acts through inciting statements, aimed at pitting individuals, groups and ethnic nationalities against one another. The DSS warned that it would not tolerate the orchestrations by subversive and unscrupulous elements to cause a breakdown of law and order in Nigeria. It said, “The service reiterates its commitment to the internal security of Nigeria and will, within the confines of the law, decisively deal with planners of the mayhem. “Law abiding citizens are urged to go about their normal business and disregard the antics of agents of destabilisation.”
