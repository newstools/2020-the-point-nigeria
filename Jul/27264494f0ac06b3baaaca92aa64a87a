… says ‘it’s cheap blackmail Governor Godwin Obaseki of Edo State has denied allegations that his government destroyed campaign billboards of the Governorship Candidate of the All Progressives Congress, Osagie Ize-Iyamu. In a statement, on Saturday, by his Special Adviser on Media and Communication Strategy, Crusoe Osagie, the Governor dismissed the claims as belated antics “of a routinely recycled politician who has nothing to offer to Edo people.” Obaseki said the allegations were ludicrous and unfounded, noting that the tactic was true to Ize-Iyamu’s approach to politics, which he said, had never won him any success in previous elections. The statement said, “Anyone who knows Ize-Iyamu very well knows that this is his approach to politics. He raises the alarm and cries wolf when no one is chasing him. The state government has not removed any of his billboards. This is cheap blackmail to score lame political points. “Ize-Iyamu is a politician that assumes relevance during every election cycle. This is what he does for a living and has no other job. It is not surprising to see these statements from him and his team. He should not be taken seriously, and his statements should be disregarded. “He would go back to his cocoon after he has been defeated at the September 19, 2020 election and would most likely resurface after four years to repeat this cycle. So, we are used to his childish charades.”
