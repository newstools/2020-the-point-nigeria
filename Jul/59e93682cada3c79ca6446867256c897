THE Federal Government has declared Thursday, July 30 and Friday, July 31 as public holidays to mark this year’s Eid-el-Kabir celebrations. This was contained in a statement, signed by the Permanent Secretary, Federal Ministry of Interior, Georgina Ehuriah, on Tuesday. The statement said the Minister of Interior, Rauf Aregbesola, who made the declaration on behalf of the Federal Government, congratulated Muslims and all Nigerians, at home and abroad, on the occasion. It said, “He (Aregbesola) called on the Muslims to continue to imbibe the spirit of love, peace, kindness and sacrifice, as exemplified by the Holy Prophet Muhammad (Peace be upon Him) and to also use the period to pray for peace, unity, prosperity and the stability of the country, especially as the world is witnessing global health challenges caused by Covid-19 pandemic.” The Minister also assured Nigerians that the current administration was committed to battling the pandemic with the cooperation of all Nigerians. He emphasised that the Federal Government would continue to foster peaceful coexistence, national cohesion and stability in its march towards actualising the full potentials of the country. Aregbesola, however, advised all Nigerians to take responsibility against the spread of COVID-19 by observing social distancing, personal and respiratory hygiene, as well as other regulations issued by relevant authorities.
