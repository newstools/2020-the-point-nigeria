The Chairman of the Ekiti State Traditional Council, who is also the Alawe of Ilawe Ekiti, Oba Adebanji Alabi, has urged politicians in the state to sheath their swords and embrace peace. Alabi said with peace and stability, there would be development in the state. Alawe made the appeal in a reaction to the recent crisis among politicians in Ekiti State. He said that what Ekiti State needed now was massive development, which would benefit the majority of the people and not divisive political wrangling, which would benefit no one. He said that it was worrisome that for sometime, some politicians had been exchanging disturbing information portraying Ekiti State in bad light, adding that this must stop henceforth. “Traditional rulers, as fathers of all, consider it expedient to tell all politicians that Ekiti needs peace and development and that all hands must be on deck to ensure that we all live together peacefully and provide Government with a conducive environment to deliver the dividends of democracy to our people,” Oba Alabi stressed. The Chairman of the Traditional Rulers expressed the implicit confidence of Ekiti Traditional rulers in the administration of Governor Kayode Fayemi and pleaded that all sons and daughters of Ekiti State should continue to support the Governor in his current determination to ensure the development of the state without distraction. He further stated without equivocation that Governor Fayemi was a quintessential intellectual, imbued with administrative ingenuity, which was visible in his governance of the state. The monarch described the Governor as a pride, not only to Ekiti, but Yorubaland and our country, Nigeria.
