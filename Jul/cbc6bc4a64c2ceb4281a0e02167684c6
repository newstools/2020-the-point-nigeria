There is palpable fear in the Ondo State Government House as the wife of the Governor of Ondo State, Betty Anyanwu-Akeredolu, also tested positive for COVID-19 on Thursday. Governor Rotimi Akeredolu had embarked on self-isolation after testing positive for the virus a few days ago. Our correspondent gathered that some members of the House of Assembly and aides who went with the Governor to Abuja to submit his re-election nomination form, might have tested positive for the virus. This was even as it was learnt from official quarters that the test results had not been released. The Commissioner for Health in the state, Wahab Adegbenro, died from COVID-19 complications on Thursday. He reportedly died at the Federal Medical Center, Owo, after falling ill on Monday.
