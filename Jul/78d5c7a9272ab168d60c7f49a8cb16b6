THE Nigerian Army has announced the death of an Officer, Lt. Babakaka Ngorgi. Ngorgi, according to a statement by the Acting Director, Army Public Relations, Col Sagir Musa, was killed by a soldier in the 202 Battalion of the 21 Special Armoured Brigade, in Bama, Borno State. The soldier, who was said to be suffering from depression, reportedly shot the officer at about 10.30am on Wednesday while the latter was on a phone call in front of the headquarters. It was gathered that the killer, whose identity was not disclosed, had asked for permission to travel for the purpose of rectifying issues around his frozen salary account, but was denied a pass by the late officer. His salary had reportedly been frozen for about eight months by military authorities who punished him for absconding from duty without official leave. The Army spokesperson said the soldier had been arrested and was undergoing investigation, adding that the situation was calm in the unit. In the statement titled, “Nigerian soldier suffering from depression kills a subaltern in Borno State”, the Army noted that the remains of the deceased officer had been evacuated to 7 Division Medical Services and Hospital. “Investigation into the case has since been instituted to determine the circumstances that led to the unfortunate incident,” it said. “The Nigerian Army sympathises and condoles with the family at this trying moment, and pray for the repose of the soul of the departed,” it added.
