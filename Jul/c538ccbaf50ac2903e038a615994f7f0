… Says WAEC can’t determine resumption of Nigerian schools THE Minister of Education, Adamu Adamu, has said that Nigerian schools cannot reopen any time soon until it is safe to do so. Adamu noted that students in the various final exam classes, including those preparing for the Senior Secondary Certificate Examination, would not resume, contrary to announcements by some states, including Lagos. The Minister, who addressed State House correspondents, on Wednesday, after the virtual meeting of the Federal Executive Council, in Abuja, pointed out that the West African Examinations Council could not determine the resumption date of schools in Nigeria.
