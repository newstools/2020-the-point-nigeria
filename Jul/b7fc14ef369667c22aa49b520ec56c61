Retired civil servants under the Osun State Contributory Pension scheme, on Wednesday, protested the failure of the state government to pay their entitlements. The aged protesters are urging the Governor Gboyega Oyetola to pay their 30 months half-salary arrears (2016 till date), gratuities (2015 till date) and their monthly pensions from 2015 till date. Storming the palace of the Ooni of Ife, Oba Adeyeye Ogunwusi, the senior citizens urged the traditional ruler to help them prevail upon Governor Oyetola to offset their entitlements and save them from incessant deaths due to hunger and lack of medical care. Displaying several placards bearing inscriptions such as “Governor Oyetola, Give Us Our 30 months Half Salaries”, “Masses Help Us, We Are Dying”, “Gov Oyetola, The Dead Can’t Enjoy Road Projects”, and “Gov Oyetola Save Our Souls”, the protesters demonstrated peacefully around the ancient Ile-Ife town. Spokesperson for the retirees, Comrade Niyi Adefare, lamented the hardship that they had been faced with since the government denied them their entitlements. Adefare said some pensioners had been lying critically ill without money to buy drugs or seek comprehensive medical care. He urged the Ooni to assist them in channeling their grievances and predicaments to the state Governor for quick payments of their entitlements. “Our members are old, some of us are managing one sickness or the other but have not been able to procure drugs and other essentials because our monies have not been paid by the state government,” he said. The Ooni, who spoke through one of his chiefs, assured the protesters of his intervention.
