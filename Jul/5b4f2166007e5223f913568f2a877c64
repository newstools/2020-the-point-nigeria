The National Youth Service Corps has extended the service year of seven of its members, as four of them were said to have absconded in Osun State. The NYSC State Coordinator, Adewale Adegoke, on Thursday, said, “1412 will pass out from Batch B stream II. Four members who absconded from the service would automatically repeat the service year, while seven others would serve an extension of service for various offences committed.” According to him, the punitive measures for the erring corps members were to serve as a deterrent to other serving corps members. Adegoke noted that the scheme frowned on truancy and indiscipline. “NYSC will not hesitate to correct such acts in accordance with the provisions of the NYSC Act,” he said. He said, “Distribution of certificates to Batch B, Stream II, corps members has commenced on Thursday and the scheme has deployed officers to all the council areas in the state to ensure strict compliance with the social distancing measures for the days the exercise would last. “Award winner for the set is Anaya Patience OS/19B/4020, who served in Boluwaduro LGA. She produced a jingle on COVID-19 and also produced sanitiser and facemasks, which were distributed to the host community.”
