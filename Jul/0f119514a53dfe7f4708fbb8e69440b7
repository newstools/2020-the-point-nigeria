. An EFCC boss must be above suspicion – Presidency President Muhammadu Buhari has suspended Ibrahim Magu as the Acting Chairman of the Economic and Financial Crimes Commission. The embattled EFCC boss was arrested on Monday and made to face a Presidential panel reviewing the anti-graft agency’s activities. He had slept in police cell after the first round of interrogation on Monday. Meanwhile, the Presidency on Tuesday said Magu’s probe was an affirmation that nobody under this administration was above scrutiny. It added that anybody that had been elevated to the position of EFCC Chairman must be above suspicion. A statement issued by an official in the Presidency said Magu’s probe was to give him the opportunity to clear himself of allegations, which were described as weighty. The unsigned statement said, “The panel investigating allegations against Ag. EFCC Chairman had been sitting for some weeks now. “In consonance with the principle of fairness and justice, it was needful that the Ag. Chairman be given the opportunity to respond to the allegations, which are, weighty in nature.” It added that under the Buhari administration, nobody was above scrutiny, noting that the investigation was to reinforce transparency and accountability. The statement stressed, “Accountability for our actions or inactions is an inalienable part of democracy. In such an elevated position as that of EFCC Chairman, the holder of the position must be above suspicion. “There’s no prejudgment. Absolutely none. The Buhari administration can be counted on to uphold fairness.” Magu’s ordeal began with a memo by the Attorney-General of the Federation, Abubakar Malami, accusing him of gross infractions.
