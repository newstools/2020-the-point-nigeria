Police, at the Ikotun Division, Lagos, have arrested a man, Oyedeji Nurudeen, for defiling his two underage daughters. Nurudeen, who resides at Oshidola Street, Pako Bus Stop, Igando Road, in Ikotun, had reportedly been sleeping with his daughters, aged 17 and 14 years, since 2015. The daughters, while exposing their father’s evil act, said he had been having sex with them since they were nine and 12 years, respectively. A police source told our correspondent that the matter was reported at the Family Support Unit of the Ikodun Police Division when the older daughter decided to expose “their father’s evil deeds.” The police later charged the suspect to Ogba Magistrate’s Court for defiling his daughters. At the hearing, the court refused to grant his plea as the prosecutor, Supol Ezekiel Ayorinde, asked the Court to refer the matter to the DPP. The Presiding Magistrate, Mrs. B.O. Osunsanmi, ordered that he should be remanded in a correctional centre without an option of bail and directed the prosecutor to duplicate the file and send to the DPP for advice.
