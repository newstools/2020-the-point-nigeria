FORMER National Chairman of the All Progressives Congress, Adams Oshiomhole, on Friday, said leaders of the Peoples Democratic Party supplied the documents that nailed Edo State Governor, Godwin Obaseki. Oshiomhole said the APC screening committee disqualified Obaseki based on the evidence provided in 2016 by PDP leaders when they dragged him to court over alleged forgery of certificate. He said, “Let me tell you, members of APC’s screening committee knew that the man who forged documents, even if you vote for him, you know what happened to us in Bayelsa State. “So, I need to assure you that the decision of the screening committee members to disqualify the sitting governor (of Edo State) was based on the evidence provided by PDP leaders in 2016, which they found to be correct and you do not repeat the same mistake twice.” Oshiomhole added, “The only task we have is to go to every unit, every community, every ward, every local government area and remind them of where we stopped and ask them, since we left, what new thing has been brought? “If I failed Godwin Obaseki’s examination, by the grace of God, on Pastor Osagie Ize-Iyamu, I will score A1. It is not unusual to misread people but it will be unusual after misreading them, you continue on that dangerous path. “We have a duty to correct it. I assure you that there are no personal issues whatsoever. I hear some people say Oshiomhole has lost his seat as the National Chairman of APC and I asked ‘is it my father’s job?’”
