… decorates him as role model The Nigeria Youth Advocacy for Good Governance Initiative has described the Acting Chairman of the Economic and Financial Crimes Commission, Ibrahim Magu, as an icon of humanitarian services and role model to Nigerian youths. The group made the description on Tuesday in Abuja, while presenting a Golden Role Model Award to him at the Corporate Headquarters of the EFCC. The Coordinator of the Group, Akeem Abiodun, who made the presentation to Magu, lauded his “dogged spirit in the fight against corruption” and noted that the group, after conducting extensive survey of “his inspiring and enthralling track records, considered him worthy of the award.” Abiodun described Magu as a, “father, leader, achiever, pacesetter, role model, pathfinder and a result-oriented leadership image in Nigeria.” In his response, the anti-corruption boss expressed appreciation to the group’s initiative, stressing that the award was coming at a right time. He urged the group to continue in its advocacy for good governance and promised to continue to spearhead the fight against corruption in order to give youths a better future. He also noted that the current happenings in the country and around the world, such as banditry, insurgency, pestilence and unemployment were artificial and end results of corruption. He encouraged the group to stay in touch with the EFCC and contribute its quota in waging war against corruption and economic crimes.
