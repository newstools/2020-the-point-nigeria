THE Federal Airports Authority of Nigeria has berated the Head of the Department of State Services at the international terminal of NAIA, Abuja, Safiyanu Abba, for “deliberately obstructing airport security process, and slapping an Aviation Security Officer.” In a statement published on its official twitter handle, FAAN said he had obstructed further searching of a visitor who had walked through the metal detector and activated the alarm. The Authority condemned the act, which it described as an abuse of power. FAAN had, in recent times raised the alarm over the conduct of some Very Important Persons who had flouted COVID-19 protocols at some of Nigeria’s airports. In the statement, titled, “Breach of Security Procedure and Assault on AVSEC Officer by Head of DSS at the International Terminal of NAIA Abuja,” the Authority said, “We note with dismay that Mr Safiyanu Abba, the Head of DSS at NAIA, deliberately obstructed airport security process, and slapped an Aviation Security Officer who was performing his duty. “This happened on the 17th July at about 15:25 hours. He breached security procedure by obstructing further searching of a visitor who had just walked through the metal detector and activated the alarm. “The Federal Airports Authority of Nigeria strongly condemns this abuse of power and the Security process in our airport. This has also been duly escalated. FAAN is committed to our core values of safety, security and comfort.”
