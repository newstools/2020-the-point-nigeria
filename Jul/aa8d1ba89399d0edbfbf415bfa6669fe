The Lagos State Government has sealed 10 private schools that flouted the directive on closure of schools by the Federal and State governments to contain the spread of the COVID-19 pandemic in the country. The Director-General, Office of Education Quality Assurance, Lagos State, Mrs. Abiola Seriki-Ayeni, disclosed this on Friday. Seriki-Ayeni, who had led the Monitoring and Investigation team from her office, said private schools found not to have complied with the closure directive were sealed even as she disclosed that a large number complied. She said the sealed schools were holding lessons for their students in large numbers and not respecting the COVID-19 protocols, noting that the monitoring would continue and offenders punished. The DG said, “No doubt, COVID-19 has had negative effects on our schools but we want students to come out stronger and better. “We want to make sure schools are closed; we also want to make sure schools are adhering to the closure directive since the number of COVID-19 infection cases has increased dramatically over time. “On the field, we want to stay put to what we know is true and we want to consistently do it to students and school-based staff.” She warned against the exposure and clustering of students in a class, adding that any school found operating, while trying to beat government scrutiny without concern for the health and safety of pupils would be sealed. “This is a unique time in the entire world, therefore, it is only the living that learns,” she noted.
