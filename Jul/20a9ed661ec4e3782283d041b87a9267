The undercurrent war between the Attorney General of the Federation, Abubakar Malami, and the Acting Chairman of the Economic and Financial Crimes Commission, Ibrahim Magu, might have been escalated for urgent attention by President Muhammadu Buhari. Reliable sources had told our correspondent that Magu was arrested by security operatives in traffic, just after he drove out of his office at Wuse 2. The operatives, who were acting on superior orders, were said to have told the EFCC boss that his attention was needed in the Villa. He is reportedly being interrogated at the Villa as of the time of filing this report. The AGF had, a few days ago, accused him of gross infractions in his line of duty. The EFCC has not issued an official statement as at press time.
