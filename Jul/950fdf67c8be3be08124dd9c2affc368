… as eight nominees await final decision EIGHT candidates from four continents will appear before a World Trade Organisation panel today (Wednesday), as the process of selecting who becomes the Organisation’s Director-General continues. The nomination stage had closed on July 8, 2020, with controversies trailing the nomination of Nigeria’s former Minister of Finance and Coordinating Minister for the Economy, Ngozi Okonjo-Iweala. Three female and five male candidates are expected to face members of the international trade negotiation and dispute settling institution, from its 164 member states, between July 15 to 17. Okonjo-Iweala is expected to meet the WTO members at 15:00hrs on Wednesday (today) to present her vision while she will also respond to questions from the floor. Other candidates jostling for the WTO job are: Abdel-Hamid Mamdouh (Egypt), Amina Mohamed (Kenya), Jesús Kuri (Mexico), Tudor Ulianovschi (Moldova), Yoo Myung-hee (Korea), Mohammad Al-Tuwaijri (Saudi Arabia), and Liam Fox (United Kingdom). Okonjo-Iweala, who hopes to break the record as the first female or African DG of the WTO since its creation in 1995, raised the alarm, last week, that some powerful Nigerians were working against her emergence.
