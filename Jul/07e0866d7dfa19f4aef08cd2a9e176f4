There was commotion in the House of Representatives on Monday, when the Acting Managing Director of the Niger Delta Development Commission, Kemebradikumo Pondei, slumped while responding to questions from members of the House of Representatives Committee investigating the activities of the Commission. The former Chairman of the committee, Olubunmi Tunji-Ojo, had recused himself and handed over to another member to direct the affairs of the Commission on allegations of complicity in the whole process. Pondei had earlier told the sitting that his Interim Management Committee received about N72 billion from the Federal Government, out of which N38.6bn was expended on capital projects and N20.5bn on recurrent expenditure. At the point the Acting MD was told to explain what the N1.5bn he said had been spent on the management, including himself, was meant for, he tried to evade the question and eventually slumped. He has since been revived and taken out of the Assembly complex. Details laterâ€¦
