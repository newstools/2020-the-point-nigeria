 A former National Security Adviser under the Goodluck Jonathan administration, Sambo Dasuki, has denied campaigning for President Muhammadu Buhari while serving under Jonathan. He said he never worked against his boss as NSA as being “recklessly insinuated byischief makers on their blogs and social media.” In a statement on Sunday, titled, “I never campaigned for APC or Buhari as NSA to President Jonathan”, Dasuki said nothing of such happened “in whatever shape or form before, during or after the 2015 presidential elections.” “The truth is that I was involved in an attempt at forging an alliance between the Action Congress of Nigeria, All Nigeria Peoples Party,  Congress for Progressive Change, among others, prior to 2011 elections which was not successful,” he said. “My involvement in that political process ended after the elections of 2011.
I, however, assured him that I would never betray him. As a man of honour, I kept to my words,” he added.
