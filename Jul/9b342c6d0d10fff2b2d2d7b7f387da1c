 A 29-year-old phone repairer, identified as Chibuike Izzogo, of Isofumini Agbaja, in Izzi Local Government Area of Ebonyi State, has been remanded at the Abakaliki Federal Correctional Centre for attempting to kill his three-month-old baby and setting his ‘in-laws’ house ablaze. Chibuike was said to have impregnated a 20-years-old lady, who gave birth to little Amarachi, without performing any marriage rites, which according to Izzi tradition “made him just a sperm donor.” Consequently, his partner and daughter were not allowed to live with him but were being taken care of by the lady’s parents in their family compound, against his wish. The defendant was accused in the suit, numbered MAB/ 361C/2020, of attempted murder and Arson on the premise that he allegedly poured Premium Motor Spirit (petrol ) round the house where his would-be in-laws and the baby were sleeping, at night, on July 8, 2020. The entire members of the family were said to have fled the house, forgetting the baby. The baby therefore sustained second degree burns, and had to be taken for urgent medical attention. The suspect, who had no defence counsel during arraignment, was said to have also beaten his 56-year-old ‘father in-law’, Cletus Aloh, with plank and sticks, which caused him injuries on his head and legs, some days after the arson incident. He thereby committed offence punishable under Section 320(1), 443(a) and 355, all of Criminal Code Cap 33 Volume 1 Laws of Ebonyi State of Nigeria, 2009. Speaking during the arraignment, the trial Magistrate, Blessing Chukwu, ordered the remand of the suspect in Abakaliki Federal Correctional Centre and adjourned the matter to a later date for report of compliance. The trial Magistrate directed that all documents and evidences in the mater be transferred to the Department of Public Prosecution.
