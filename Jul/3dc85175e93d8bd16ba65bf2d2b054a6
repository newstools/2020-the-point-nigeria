Governor Rotimi Akeredolu of Ondo State has recovered from COVID-19. The governor disclosed this on Monday during a weekly press briefing. He said he had tested negative, twice, for the dreaded virus, according to doctorsâ€™ reports. His recovery is expected to change the direction of governance in the state, especially with the resignation of the Secretary to the State Government, Ifedayo Abegunde, and his replacement with the Commissioner of Tourism, Temitayo Oluwatuyi. The Deputy Governor, Agboola Ajayi, had given Akeredolu 31 days ultimatum to hand over power to him for being partially incapacitated.
