The Minister of Communications and Digital Economy, Isa Pantami, has said that the newly commissioned Kaduna Emergency Communication Centre, built by the Nigerian Communications Commission, alongside five Information Technology projects by other agencies under the Ministry, will boost digital economy. Speaking during the virtual commissioning of the projects, which took place at the NCC’s Communications and Digital Economy Complex at the weekend, and attended by all heads of agencies under the ministry, the minister said the projects were all connected to the country’s digital economy drive, as contained in the National Digital Economy Policy and Strategy unveiled by the President in November last year. The NCC’s ECC project, which makes it possible for people of Kaduna and environs to dial 112 Emergency Number to get help during emergencies from appropriate emergency response agencies, is aimed at supporting the Federal Government’s agenda of enhancing security of lives and property in the country. NCC had built the ECC in each of the 36 states of the federation and the FCT. Nineteen of the ECC have been activated while efforts are ongoing to extend it to other states. The Minister also commissioned the Tertiary Institution Knowledge Centre at the Enugu State Polytechnic, Iwollo, executed by the Universal Service Provision Fund of the NCC. Three other projects by the National Information Technology Development Agency – IT Community Centre in Katsina, and IT Hub, each in Ahmadu Bello University, Zaria, Main Campus, Kaduna; and University of Lagos – were also commissioned. The sixth project was the opening of Nigeria Communication Satellite (NIGCOMSAT)’s Northwest Regional Office in Kaduna. “These projects are connected to some of the pillars of the NDEPS, especially with respect to developmental regulation, digital literacy and skills, solid infrastructure, among others,” the minister said, while urging Nigerians, who are the ultimate beneficiaries of the projects, to take advantage of the opportunities. He added that he would continue to work with other ministries, departments and parastatals of government to ensure teething challenges facing ICT infrastructure deployment in the country were addressed in order to deepen digital economy.
Governor of Borno State and Chairman of the occasion, Babagana Zulum; as well as the Minister of Finance, Budget and National Planning, Zainab Ahmed; and her counterpart in the Ministry of Works and Housing, Babatunde Fashola; who were guests of honour, commended the ministry and its agencies for expanding the footprint of digital economy across the country. Meanwhile, the Executive Vice Chairman of NCC, Umar Danbatta, and other heads of agencies under the Ministry, have commended the Minister for promoting synergy among the agencies under his supervision. “The projects will help in leading the country into a truly-digital economy,” Danbatta said. He restated the Commission’s commitment to ensuring a robust broadband infrastructure in the country, to support government’s initiatives, aimed at accelerating the implementation of National Digital Economy Policy and Strategy.
