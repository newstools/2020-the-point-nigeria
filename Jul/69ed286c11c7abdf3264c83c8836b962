…thanks party’s state governors for ‘knowing their responsibilities PRESIDENT Muhammadu Buhari has commended members of the Mai Mala Buni-led All Progressives Congress Caretaker Committee for the work they are doing in repositioning the governing party. Recall that, following the suspension of the former National Chairman of the party, Adams Oshiomhole, and the dissolution of the National Working Committee of the APC in June, the National Executive Committee had appointed the Yobe State Governor to lead the Caretaker/ Extraordinary National Convention Committee. At Tuesday’s virtual interaction with the governors of the APC-controlled states, with Vice President Yemi Osinbajo in attendance, the President said, “I am pleased with the Chairman and the work of the committee. He is highly mobile in the efforts to coordinate and strengthen the party. I am happy with his personal efforts.” President Buhari also appreciated the efforts of the APC Governors following the successful conduct of the party’s primaries in Edo and Ondo states, saying, “I am happy that they know their responsibilities as Governors and have identified the right priorities.” Speaking on behalf of his colleagues, the Governor of Kebbi State and Chairman of the Progressives Governors Forum, Senator Atiku Bagudu, thanked President Buhari for taking the right steps to resolve the crisis in the party. The APC Governors also commended the President for his handling of security issues and the economy, noting in particular, the success recorded in pulling the country out of the 2016 economic recession as well as the ongoing management of the COVID-19 pandemic. “We are proud of your leadership and achievements,” the Governors told President Buhari.
