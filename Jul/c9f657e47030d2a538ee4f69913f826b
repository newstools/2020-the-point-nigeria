It was jubilation galore amid mourning at the Auchi residence of former Edo State Speaker, late Zakawanu Garuba, as his abducted wife, Hajia Hassana Garuba, regained her freedom last night. The demise of the late Speaker had thrown Auchi, the entire Etsako West LGA, and Edo State, into mourning. But as soon as news filtered in about the release of the widow of the late politician by her abductors, residents of the ancient city went wild with joy. Hajia Garuba was reportedly freed and handed over to those who negotiated the ransom at Okpella, a border town between Edo and Kogi. The exact amount paid for her release is still shrouded in secrecy. Tired and speechless over her ordeal, Hajia Garuba, sandwiched among friends and family members, could only manage to wave to visitors and well wishers in appreciation of their solidarity and prayers. Speaking on behalf of the Garuba family, Kadiri Garuba, the younger brother of the late politician, expressed profound gratitude to the state governor, Mr Godwin Obaseki, and several others who shared in the family’s pain and agony, stating that the worst was over. Recall that Garuba’s widow was kidnapped three days ago along the notorious Okene- Abuja highway. She was part of an advance party dispatched to await the arrival of the corpse of her late husband.
