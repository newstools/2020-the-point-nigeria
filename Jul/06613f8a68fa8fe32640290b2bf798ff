… Ortom’s family goes into total isolation Governor Samuel Ortom, on Saturday, confirmed that his wife had tested positive for COVID-19, disclosing also that the Secretary to the State Government, Prof. Anthony Ijohor, had also tested positive for the virus. Other officials of the state government that have tested positive for the dreaded virus, according to the Governor, include the Chief of Staff, Tewarse Obunde; and Head of Service, Veronica Onyeke. Ortom, who spoke during a press briefing on Saturday, urged everyone who had come in contact with them in the last two weeks to self isolate. The news has thrown the people of Benue into confusion, considering the fact that the topmost officials of the state government had been infected. The governor said the first family, including himself had decided to go into total isolation. He urged the people of Benue to go for tests and ascertain their status in order to take the proper action. “One lesson I want Benue people to take and understand is that everybody has to make himself available for testing. The more you test, the more you know your status; when you know that you are positive, then you can subject yourself to treatment. Ortom’s wife, Eunice, had announced late Friday, that she and her daughter, including some of her staff, had tested positive for the dreaded virus. She, however, reminded the people of Benue that it was not a death sentence and urged everyone to take preventive measures. She also advised everyone who had come in contact with her in the last two weeks to self-isolate.
