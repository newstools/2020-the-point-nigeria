Former President Goodluck Jonathan is currently meeting behind closed-doors with President Muhammadu Buhari, at the Presidential Villa, Abuja. The former President, who arrived at the Aso Villa, at about 11am on Tuesday, proceeded straight to the President’s office. Though observers have noted a growing romance between the two leaders, this meeting may not be unconnected with the former president’s recent assignment in Mali. Recall that the Economic Community of West African States recently appointed Jonathan as a Special Envoy for Mali. The opposition group in Mali, where there is currently a leadership tussle, had turned down the recommendation of a government of national unity by the Jonathan–led committee. The former President, as is the norm, is expected to brief Buhari on the activities of his committee.
