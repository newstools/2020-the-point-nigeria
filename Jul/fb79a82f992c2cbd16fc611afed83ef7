Medical doctors in Lagos State have called off their three days warning strike. The doctors embarked on a warning strike on Monday, over what they described as wage disparity between doctors working with the Federal Government and their state counterparts. They also complained about non-payment of hazard allowance, disengagement of doctors at the isolation centres, among others. The striking doctors said the strike was called off to pave the way for meaningful discussions with the state government on their various demands. Doctors are expected to resume at their duty posts on Thursday, the Chairman of the Medical Guild, Dr. Oluwajimin Sodipo, was quoted as saying. Details later.
