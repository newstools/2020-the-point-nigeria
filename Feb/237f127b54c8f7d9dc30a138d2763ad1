Chieftain of the Peoples Democratic Party in Oyo State, Hon. Wale Gbadamosi, has blamed the immediate past governor of the state, Senator Abiola Ajimobi, for the current crisis rocking the administration of local government councils in the state. Gbadamosi, who expressed concern over the magnitude of the crisis, said Governor Seyi Makinde’s decision on the issue in recent times was to save the state from “democratic mess.” He added that that quagmire created by the Ajimobi government was aimed at creating a tough time for his successor, Makinde. The PDP chieftain said, “The action of Governor Seyi Makinde administration in dissolving the former local government councils and appointing caretaker chairmen was to right the wrong by the last APC administration. “Former governor Ajimobi’s administration erred ab initio by violating a court order to conduct the said selection called election in to the councils and LCDAs, thereby rendering the constitution of ALGON Oyo null and void. “The caretakers were appointed in accordance with the laws of the state House of Assembly to oversee the councils to prevent continued vacuum in the running of the local government system before the local government elections later this year.” Gbadamosi also expressed disappointment with the approach of the Attorney General of the Federation, Abubakar Malami, in addressing the matter. He said, “The letter of intervention written by the Attorney General is unexpected and I think this led to the confrontations and crisis at the local government secretariats across the state. “The current government in Oyo State is a government of the people and operates in accordance with the constitution of the country. “My advice to the sacked illegal chairmen is that they should await the outcome of the judgment of the Court of Appeals on February 19, 2020, while they obey the High Court judgment restraining them from resuming in office for now.”
