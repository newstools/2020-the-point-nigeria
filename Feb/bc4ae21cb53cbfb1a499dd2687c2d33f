Governor Nyesom Wike of Rivers State, on Thursday, lambasted the National Chairman of the All Progressives Congress, Adams Oshiomhole, and called on the Federal Government to call him toshiomhole to stop making inflammatory remarks capable of destabilising the country, noting that the APC National Chairman had no power to stop the inauguration of the candidate of the Peoples Democratic Party, Douye Diri. The governor, who reacted to Oshiomhole’s statement in Port Harcourt, said, “The Federal Government should warn Oshiomhole to stop making remarks that will destabilise Nigeria. What he is doing in Edo State is not proper and he should not bring it to the rest of the Niger Delta. “Who is Oshiomhole to determine who has spread in a state? Supreme Court has made a ruling. It is unfortunate for Oshiomhole to come forward to say that nobody will be sworn in.” He said Oshiomhole was making unguarded statements, pointing out that he had lost the support of APC governors, and wanted to curry favour with his careless talks. Wike said, “It is most unfortunate what Oshiomhole is doing because he wants to retain his position as national chairman. APC governors have rejected him; that is why he is struggling to prove that he is fighting for the party. “He is making statements as if he owns the country. This is the same way he is carrying on in Edo State, fighting the governor. He believes that he has the forcesrnor. He believes that he has the forces to cause crisis. He is arrogating powers to himself, which is not good.”
