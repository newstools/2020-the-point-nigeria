National Examinations Council on Tuesday dismissed 19 workers from service for certificate forgery, after they confessed to the crime. NECO said its Governing Board approved the dismissal of the workers following the recommendations of a Staff Certificate Verification Committee constituted by the management. The committee had invited some of the staff “with questionable credentials to appear before it, during which the affected staff attested that their certificates were forged.” The dismissal of the 19 workers brings to 89 staff disengaged from NECO within three months. In November 2019, it dismissed 70 workers for certificate forgery. In a release on Tuesday, NECO Head of Information and Public Relations Division, Mr. Azeez Sani, said the dismissal of the erring workers was approved at the 52nd Regular meeting of the council. Sani said, “The Governing Board of the National Examinations Council has approved the dismissal of 19 staff from her service for certificate forgery. A Staff Certificate Verification Committee constituted by the Management carried out its assignment diligently by inviting some staff with questionable credentials to appear before it, during which the affected staff attested that their certificates were forged. “The committee also contacted the schools and institutions which the affected staff claimed to have attended and the Schools and Institutions denied having certificated them. “At its 52nd Regular meeting, the Governing Board of the Council vetted the report of the Certificate Verification Committee and approved the dismissal of the affected staff. “The Governing Board had at its 17th Extra-Ordinary meeting in November, 2019, also approved the dismissal of 70 staff for certificate forgery. The certificate verification exercise, which is ongoing, is aimed at sanitising the system.”
