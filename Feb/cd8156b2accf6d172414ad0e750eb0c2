‘No plan to give $100m to Kebbi gov’  The Attorney-General of the Federation and Minister of Justice, Abubakar Malamu (SAN), has reacted to reports of a planned handing over of $100m from Abacha loot to an All Progressives Congress governor, which was opposed by the United States, saying that the repatriated funds would be used for the development of critical infrastructure in the country. Malami said in a statement by his Special Assistant on Media and Public Relations, Dr. Umar Gwandu, that there was no such plan to give over $100m of the latest tranche of the recovered $300m Abacha loot to the Kebbi State Governor, Atiku Bagudu, or any other third-party interest. According to him, the Governor is pursuing separate cases in court in the United States and the United Kingdom to assert his right in relation to the Abacha loot. Nigeria, he said was cooperating with the US with respect to the recovery of several other assets, including what was described as “corruption proceeds linked to former Petroleum Minister Deziani Alison-Madueke and her associates, and former State Governor James Ibori as well as several others.” The AGF maintained that the repatriated funds would be used for infrastructural projects as agreed with the foreign countries where the funds were recovered. He listed the Abuja-Kano Road, Second Niger Bridge, and the Lagos-Ibadan Expressway as projects that would benefit from the fund. Malami said it was mischievous and pedestrian for anyone to seek to turn the law and the facts “on its head on the matter of repatriation whose terms are clearly spelt out and agreed among the parties.” “This long-standing cooperation recently culminated in the successful signing of memorandum of understanding for the repatriation of over $300 million looted assets associated with General Sani Abacha,” he said, adding, “It is pertinent to recall at this juncture that prior to the 2020 agreement with the United States and the Island of Jersey, the Federal Government has signed an agreement for the return  of  over $300 million US Dollars in 2017 which was effectively deployed for the purpose for which it was agreed to be applied without any issue of reputation.”
