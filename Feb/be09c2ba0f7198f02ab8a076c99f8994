A Federal High Court sitting in Abuja has jailed a former National Publicity Secretary of the Peoples Democratic Party, Olisa Metuh, seven years for corruption. Justice Okon Abang on Tuesday in his six-hour judgment, convicted Metuh on all the seven counts, including the fraudulent receipt of N400m  from the Office of the National Security Adviser in November 2014 and use of the money for political activities of the PDP and for his personal purposes. The judge also convicted Metuh for transacting with a cash sum of $2million without going through a financial institution. The court agreed with the Economic and Financial Crimes Commission that the transaction violated the anti-money laundering law, which pegs the maximum cash transaction an individual can undertake outside a financial institution at N5million. Justice Abang sentenced Metuh to seven years imprisonment for counts 1, 2, 4 and 7, five years for count 3, and three years for counts 5 and 6. But the sentences are to run concurrently, implying that Metuh would only spend seven years in prison. The judge also fined the former PDP spokesman N375m, which he must pay to the Federal Government. Destra Investments was also ordered to pay N25million to the Federal Government. He ordered the accounts of  Destra in Diamond Bank and Asset Resource Management to be closed and their proceeds forfeited to the Federal Government. Justice Abang also ordered the winding up of Destra.
