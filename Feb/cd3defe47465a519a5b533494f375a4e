Governor Bello Matawalle of Zamfara State has reacted to the recent outbursts by ex-governor Abdulazeez Yari, describing his eight years in government as a waste. Addressing defectors from, Talata Mafara, the country home of the former governor, Matawalle said it was a clear shame for Yari to now bow to the APC National Chairman, Adams Oshiomole, who he thoroughly verbally abused during the 2019 election. According to him, the recent utterances of the former governor was clearly an act of desperation and ignorance. “It is now that you are shaking hands with people because, you are nobody. Remember, when you were in power, you refused to shake hands with even your friends because of power, arrogance’, he added. Governor Matawalle stressed that government would not fold its arms and allow unscrupulous people to create confusion and anarchy in the state. He urged the good people of the state to distance themselves from confused and greedy politicians, who had no interest in the peace and tranquility of the state. The governor described the tenure of former governor Yari as a calamity as many innocent souls were lost during the period.
