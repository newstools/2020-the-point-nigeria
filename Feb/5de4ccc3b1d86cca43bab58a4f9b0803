The Osun State Council of Traditional Rulers has suspended the Oluwo of Iwo, Oba Abdulrasheed Akanbi, for six months. The council also constituted a committee headed by Orangun of Ila, Oba Wahab Adedotun, to further investigate the matter involving Oluwo and Obas in Iwo land. The monarchs at an emergency meeting at the Osun State Government Secretariat, Abere, under the chairmanship of the Ooni of Ife, Oba Adeyeye Ogunwusi, took the decision to suspend the Oluwo. It was gathered that Oluwo’s suspension was partly due to his alleged disrespect for the Alaafin of Oyo, Alake of Egbaland and the Ooni of Ife. The royal fathers also banned the Iwo monarch from attending their meetings. After the meeting, the Orangun of Ila, Oba Wahab Adedotun, said the decision was not because of the alleged fight between the Oluwo and Agbowu, but due to his conduct to other traditional rulers in Yorubaland, including the Alaafin of Oyo, Oba Lamidi Adeyemi, Alake of Egbaland and the Ooni of Ile-Ife, Oba Adeyeye Ogunwusi. The Oluwo was alleged to have punched a fellow monarch, the Agbowu of Ogbaagbaa, Oba Dhikurulahi Akinropo, during a peace meeting in the office of the Assistant Inspector General of Police Zone XI, Bashir Makama, who had summoned the royal fathers to resolve a dispute between the monarch and members of Iwo traditional rulers council.
