The Lagos State Government has told Lagosians and all Nigerians to ignore rumours making the rounds that there are suspected Coronavirus cases in Gowon Estate, Alimosho. There had been unconfirmed reports that some Chinese who recently returned from Wuhan, China, living at Osoba Close in Gowon Estate, had severe symptoms of the Coronavirus disease and were treating the symptoms themselves. But the Commissioner for Health, in Lagos, Prof. Akin Abayomi, in a statement on Wednesday dismissed the report as false. Abayomi said this while giving an update on the investigation carried out by his ministry through its surveillance team, noting that there were no “suspected or confirmed cases of Coronavirus in Lagos State, contrary to fake news being circulated in the media.” He said, “In a bid to further investigate the rumour, the surveillance team of the Lagos State Ministry of Health and the Alimosho community stakeholders were in Gowon Estate and its environs – the alleged scene of the suspected cases, on February 9, 2019. “The team interrogated residents living in and around Osoba Street in Alaguntan Ward, Segun Majekodunmi Street and other randomly selected houses in Alimosho but there were no Chinese nationals residing or carrying on business in and around any of the streets and communities visited. “The team expanded its search to hotels around Alimosho and Gowon Estate where a Taiwanese lady was identified to have visited one of the hotels but nothing concrete linking her to China was found. Three Egyptian nationals, who were sighted buying drugs at a particular pharmacy were also interrogated but were found to be businessmen who had no link whatsoever with China. ” According to the commissioner, the contact phone numbers of Alimosho LGA Disease Surveillance Notification Officer have been given to relevant stakeholders in Alimosho in case of any emergency relating to coronavirus.
