 Oba Abdulrasheed Akanbi, the Oluwo of Iwo, has been suspended for six months by the Osun State Council of Traditional Rulers. The royal fathers arrived at the decision to suspend Oba Akanbi at an emergency meeting, on Friday, presided over by Ooni of Ife, Oba Adeyeye Ogunwusi. The Oluwo had been at the centre of a controversy that began after he allegedly physically assaulted another monarch, the Agbowu of Ogbaagbaa, Oba Dikrullahi Akinropo. The Council also constituted a committee, headed by Orangun of Ila, Oba Wahab Adedotun, to further investigate the matter. Details laterâ€¦
