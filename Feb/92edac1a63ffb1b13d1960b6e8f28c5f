The Supreme Court has nullified the election of Bayelsa State governor-elect, David Lyon, and his running mate, Biobarakuma Degi-Eremienyo. According to the schedule, the Governor and his deputy were supposed to be inaugurated tomorrow (Friday). Justice Mary Peter-Odili led a five-man panel of the Supreme Court. The court ordered the Independent National Electoral Commission to withdraw the Certificate of Return issued to the All Progressives Congress’ candidates who had been declared winners of the November 16, 2019 governorship election in the state. INEC was ordered to issue fresh certificates to the candidates of the party with the next highest votes and with the required constitutional spread of votes in the results of the election. They are the PDP candidates. The judgement was made after the court disqualified the Deputy Governorship Candidate of the APC, Degi-Eremienyo, as a candidate in the election. The court upheld the November 12, 2019 judgment of the Federal High Court in Abuja, which had disqualified Degi-Eremienyo in the election for submitting forged certificates to INEC. The apex court said Degi-Eremienyo’s disqualification had affected the joint ticket in the November 16, 2019 election.
