PRESIDENT Muhammadu Buhari and Vice President Yemi Osinbajo have urged the people of Ondo State and residents to vote massively for the candidate of the All Progressives Congress in the October 10 governorship election, Rotimi Akeredolu. Buhari and Osinbajo joined the mammoth crowd of supporters, virtually, at the mega rally of the APC, in Akure, the state capital. The President, who said he was particularly interested in the Ondo APC Campaign, added that Akeredolu had performed well in his four years of governance, and was a good brand for the ruling party. According to him, the governor has taken Ondo State to a new level of prosperity and should rightly be given a second chance. Buhari encouraged the electorate to vote for the APC candidate without fear of molestation. The APC listed the construction of the Ore interchange flyover, which they said had stopped accidents on the Ore highway, as a major achievement of the Akeredolu administration. Akeredolu faces Eyitayo Jegede of the Peoples Democratic Party, and Agboola Ajayi of the Zenith Labour Party, among other candidates, in the Saturday poll.
