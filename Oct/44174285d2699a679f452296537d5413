FATIMA, daughter of former Chairman of the Economic and Financial Crimes Commission, Nubu Ribadu, on Tuesday, apologised to those who were not happy with her choice of wedding dress. Some Muslims criticised Fatima’s wedding dress, which they said revealed her body, pointing to the Islamic background of both her father, and the father of the groom, former Vice President Atiku Abubakar. The daughter of the former EFCC boss got married to Aliyu, Atiku’s son, in Asokoro, Abuja, on Saturday, in a classy wedding attended by dignitaries across Nigeria, including the National Leader of the All Progressives Congress, Bola Tinubu. Others who were present at the wedding included Governor Mai Mala Buni of Yobe State, APC chieftain, Bisi Akande, Governor Nasir El-Rufai of Kaduna State, and his Kano State counterpart, Abdullahi Ganduje, among others. The father of the groom, Atiku Abubakar was also present. Fatima explained in a statement that people would think she exposed her body because the colour of the dress was the same as the colour of her skin. “I cannot expose my skin. My wedding dress has the same colour with that of my skin, but I still apologise to my friends and family who don’t like what happened and I hope to learn from this,” she said.
