The anniversary lecture will be chaired by former Vice President Namadi Sambo. The centre’s yearly lecture series is unarguably the biggest political event in the Northern Nigeria. The Director of the Centre, Shuaibu Aliyu, said, “This year’s is a special one, being a milestone celebration of 50 years of our existence. It will be big, elaborate and unique.” Other activities lined up for the celebration include: exhibition on the life and times  of  Sir Ahmadu Bello, the Sardauna of Sokoto. There is also an Award Presentation to be given to eminent personalities that played and continue to play important roles in the  development and growth of Arewa House in the last five decades. The programme is scheduled for the  Banquet Hall at 10:00am inside the expansive Arewa House complex, the last official residence of the premier of the Northern region, late Sir Ahmadu Bello. Arewa House was established in 1970 when a committee was tasked to write a book on the history of the Northern Nigeria. The house was the official residence of Sir Ahmadu Bello, the first and only Premier of Northern Nigeria. The house was then converted to a research centre in 1970, after a committee, known as the History of Northern Nigerian Committee, was given the responsibility of writing a book on the history of Northern Nigeria.
