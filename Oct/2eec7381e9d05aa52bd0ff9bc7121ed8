WORKERS at the Federal Airports Authority of Nigeria, on Thursday, embarked on a one-day warning strike to protest the non-payment of the outstanding balance of their salaries and allowances. The National Union of Air Transport Employees, Air Transport Services Senior Staff Association of Nigeria and the Association of Nigerian Aviation Professionals had, on Wednesday, issued a notice of the one-day warning strike. This was after the expiration of a seven days ultimatum earlier issued to the management of FAAN to meet the workersâ€™ demands. The unions locked the main gates of the FAAN headquarters, preventing the Minister of Aviation, Hadi Sirika, from holding a planned town hall meeting on the demands with workers. The workers are asking for the immediate payment of outstanding allowances, leave allowances, remittance of contributory pensions, cooperative deductions, gratuity of retired staff and death benefits. They are also demanding the immediate release of aviation intervention funds, immediate implementation of the national minimum wage and immediate reparation of 2020 actuarial valuation, among others. Owing to the warning strike, activities of aviation agencies, with offices inside the FAAN headquarters complex, have been crippled. In this regard, workers at the Nigerian Airspace Management Agency and the Nigerian Quarantine Services have been shut out of their offices, The Point learnt.
