HOODLUMS attacked the Palace of the Oba of Lagos at Iga Idugaran on Wednesday. The armed thugs vandalised vehicles and carted away valuables, including ancient artefacts, our correspondent learnt. They also stole the Oba’s staff of office as shown in a viral video on Wednesday. “They’ve stolen the staff of office,” a voice was heard saying. Eyewitnesses said the attack was in reaction to the shooting and killing of peaceful young protesters in Lekki on Tuesday night. The thugs defied curfew and warnings to carry out their act, after series of attacks on strategic places in the early hours of Wednesday. The palace has not made an official statement as of the time of filing this report. Hoodlums had earlier in the morning attacked the family house of Governor Babajide Sanwo-Olu, following the shooting at Lekki tollgate on Tuesday night, which has drawn widespread anger in the country. Sanwo-Olu has suspended all state activities for the next three days. He said in a state broadcast on Wednesday morning that the only activities that would go on would be those associated with securing lives and property. He pleaded with parents to advise their wards to calm down, apologising on behalf of the government to Lagosians for the turn of events, which led to the killing of some protesters at the Lekki tollgate on Tuesday night.
