PRESIDENT Muhammadu Buhari has assured former Minister of Finance and Coordinating Minister of the Economy, Ngozi Okonjo-Iweala, of the full support of the Nigerian government in her struggle to emerge the first female Director-General of the World Trade Organisation. The President said the Federal Government would do everything possible to ensure she gets the position, not only because she is a Nigerian but also because she is a hard-working Nigerian. The President spoke when he received Okonjo-Iweala at the Presidential Villa, Abuja. The former Nigerian finance minister is one of two finalists, from an initial list of eight, contesting for the top position of the WTO. The other contender is the South Korean Trade Minister, Yoo Myung-hee. “I assure you that we will do all that we can to ensure that you emerge as the Director-General of WTO, not only because you are a Nigerian, but because you are a hardworking Nigerian. You deserve this,’’ President Buhari said. He promised to rally the support of world leaders for that purpose. “I did the same for Dr Akinwunmi Adesina for President of the African Development Bank. Both of you served the country under the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP). You are both highly qualified. We will continue to support you. I will immediately make those calls,’’ he added. Okonjo-Iweala thanked the President and the Ministers of Foreign Affairs and Industry, Trade and Investment for their support “I feel very proud of Nigeria. I am getting so much support from you, Mr President, Chief of Staff, Ministers of Foreign Affairs and Ministers of Industry, Trade and Investments. The Ministers have been working around the clock to ensure that I succeed,’’ the renowned development economist said. She, however urged the President to make “one final push within the week to beat the Koreans and bring this to Nigeria by sending a few letters and placing telephone calls to some world leaders, and also thank others for their support.”
