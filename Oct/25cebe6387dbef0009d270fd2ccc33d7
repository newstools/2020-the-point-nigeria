 REBECCA AJANI SOME private schools in Ibadan, the Oyo State capital, have advised parents to keep their children at home from Tuesday, owing to the disruption of vehicular movement and business activities by #EndSARS protesters. Our correspondent gathered that parents of some pupils who had earlier made it to school, were told to come and pick their children back home. The protests, which continued in major parts of Ibadan, gained more support as our correspondent observed that the protesters were being given drinks and light meals, as they marched along the roads, by well wishers. There was however heavy traffic in the ancient city as the protests grounded activities. Banks, especially around Orita Challenge were shut, owing apparently to the fear of attack by hoodlums, while some others offered skeletal services in some other parts. Mrs. Bolaji Akeem, who spoke to our correspondent, said she was on her way to pick her son from his private primary school. “I got a call from the school that we could come and take them home. I was also told when I got there that we should not bother bringing them on Tuesday until the school sends a notice to parents. I should not even have taken him to school in the first instance. Government must act fast to stop this and answer the youths,” the woman, also a secondary school teacher, said. The protesters had converged on the State Secretariat, Agodi early in the morning to continue their protests. Observers told The Point that the President must, as a matter of urgency, address the youth meaningfully, before the challenge becomes insurmountable.
