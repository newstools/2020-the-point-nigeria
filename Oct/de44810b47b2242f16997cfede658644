FORMER Minister of Aviation, Femi Fani-Kayode has reacted to a viral video, which suggested that he physically abused his estranged wife, Precious Chikwendu. The Peoples Democratic Party chieftain was seen in the video exchanging hot words with Chikwendu, after which the latter was heard saying, “Stop abusing me. Fani-Kayode, however, alleged that, contrary to allegations that he was physically abusing his wife in the video, he had caught her (Chikwendu), in bed, with a married man, saying the video was only a propaganda. He said he was only trying to prevent the mother of his kids from recording the face-off after he caught her with the unnamed man in bed. The couple have four kids, including a set of triplets, between them, but are reportedly separated, owing to issues that have not been clearly stated, despite refuted allegations of domestic violence against the former minister. In a series of tweets, the Fani-Kayode said, “@SaharaReporters posted a video which supposedly depicts me abusing my estranged wife. This is nothing but a propaganda video.  “There was no physical abuse. I simply took the phone from her to stop her from recording me after catching her in bed with a married man days earlier. “I repeat there was no physical abuse whatsoever and she had been insulting and subjecting everybody, including family members, staff and children, to physical and verbal abuse the whole day. As usual, it was a nightmare!” “My words in the video are self-explanatory. I urge those that watched it to listen to those words carefully. I told her that everyone wanted peace except for her and all she did was indulge in scandal after scandal. I have never physically abused my estranged wife.”
