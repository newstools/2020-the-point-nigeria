THE candidate of the Peoples Democratic Party in Saturdayâ€™s Ondo State Governorship election, Eyitayo Jegede; and his wife, Eno, were finally able to cast their votes after a little hitch. The challenge with the card reader that had not been able to read his PVC was eventually resolved by officials of the Independent National Electoral Commission. Jegede could not immediately vote on Saturday, as the smart card reader failed to read his voter card. It could not also read the PVC of his wife, Eno. The PDP candidate and his wife had been told to step aside for other voters to cast their votes. Both of them arrived at their Polling Unit 10, Ward 2, Akure South Local Government Area of the state, at about 9am.
