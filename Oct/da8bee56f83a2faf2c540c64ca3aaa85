 ADEMETO ADELEKAN HOODLUMS have attacked yet another Correctional Centre in Edo State, and freed inmates. A crowd of hoodlums were said to have overpowered security guards at Oko Medium Security Centre in Edo State, hiding under the cover of #EndSARS protests. The situation in Edo, which seems to be getting out of hand and causing fear among residents, has been condemned by #EndSARS protesters, who said thugs had hijacked the process. The Oko prison break happened on the same day a Benin Correctional Centre was attacked and inmates freed. The Edo State Government had, in reaction to the earlier development, imposed a 24-hour curfew in the state. Our correspondent learnt that many shops were burgled around the area while many took to their heels to avoid being caught up in the mayhem that ensued. The Point had reported that the Nigeria Police described the attacks on its facilities in Edo State, on Monday, by persons “posing as #EndSARS protesters” as unfortunate. The Force, in a series of tweets via its official handle @PoliceNG, confirmed that protesters carted away arms and ammunition from the armoury and freed the suspects in custody before setting some of the facilities ablaze. It, however, said the extent of the damage done could not be immediately ascertained. The Police said, “@policeNG regrettably confirms the unfortunate attacks on Police Facilities – Ugbekun Police Station, Oba Market Police Station, and Idogbo Police Post by persons posing as #EndSARS protesters in Benin, Edo State, today, Monday, 19th October 2020. “The extent of damage cannot be ascertained at the moment but the report indicates that the protesters carted away arms and ammunition from the armoury and freed the suspects in custody before setting some of the facilities ablaze.”
