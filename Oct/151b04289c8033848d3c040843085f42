BY BANYO TEMITAYO THE Minister of Foreign Affairs, Geoffrey Onyeama, is holding a meeting with ambassadors of countries in Abuja. The meeting, holding at the Foreign Affairs Ministry complex in Abuja, was convened to address the situation in the country as regards the ongoing #EndSARS protests, which had apparently been hijacked by hoodlums in key areas. The meeting is a closed-door meeting, as journalists, who had earlier been invited, were not allowed to attend. Those in attendance include the ambassadors of the United States, United Kingdom, and Germany among others. Lagos and Edo State Governments have imposed a 24-hour curfew in their states, following the violent turn of events.
