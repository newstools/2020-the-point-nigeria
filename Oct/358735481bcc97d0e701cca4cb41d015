 ADELEKE ADESANYA HOODLUMS have hijacked the #EndSARS protest in some parts of Lagos State, The Point has observed. Findings by our correspondent revealed that the hoodlums had seized some places like Ikorodu Garage, Ogolonto, Iyana Oworo, Ilupeju and others under the guise of #EndSARS protests. In Ikorodu, it was gathered that two lives were lost when the hoodlums, who were suspected cultists, took over the protests and launched an attack on a rival group. Adedayo, a resident, told The Point, “We cannot go out again as I speak with you. My mother and I had to run back home this morning when the cultists took over at the garage. “Two people have already been killed. People going to work could not make it again as some of them were robbed by hoodlums.” At Ogolonto, a resident who shared his experience on a social media platform said, “I was robbed two times this morning. My wife’s phone was collected at Ogolonto area while she was trekking when there was no vehicle again. A few minutes from the spot where her phone was collected, other hoodlums also accosted her and collected money from her with knives.” Residents in Ilupeju and Iyana Oworo said they were now forced to stay in their houses as hoodlums had taken over their streets. Meanwhile, several residents in Lagos are now stranded as majors roads are totally blocked by protesters.
