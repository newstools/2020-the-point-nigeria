 ADEMETO ADELEKAN INMATES who were set free by hoodlums in Edo State, have thanked their “saviours”, for rescuing them, saying they are happy to be free at last. A video that has gone viral showed some prisoners saying “we thank una; we thank una” as they walked hurriedly through the crowd. A freed inmate was heard telling his interviewers, “They say I be thief, I say I no be thief, they put me inside prison.” Nigerians and residents of Edo have however expressed concern over the implications of the infiltration of the streets by inmates, considering the fact that not all all them would have been innocent of the crimes they were accused of. For instance, shops along the Oko Medium Security Centre were reportedly burgled while the prison break was ongoing. Residents also ran helter-skelter to avoid being caught up in the mayhem.
