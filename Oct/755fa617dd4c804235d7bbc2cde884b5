 POPE Francis, on Wednesday, said that President Donald Trump of the United States of America “is not Christian.” The Pope was reacting to Trump’s campaign promises to deport more immigrants and force Mexico to pay for a wall along the border. Francis spoke when a reporter asked him [Pope] about the President on the papal airliner as he returned to Rome, Italy, after his six-day visit to Mexico. “A person who thinks only about building walls, wherever they may be, and not building bridges, is not Christian,” he said. The pontiff stated this barely three hours after he had concluded his Mexico trip by presiding over a huge Mass in the border city of Ciudad Juárez. He added that he “was not going to get involved in that” when asked if he was planning on influencing Catholics in how they vote in the presidential election. “I say only that this man is not Christian if he has said things like that,” Francis maintained. “We must see if he said things in that way and in this I give the benefit of the doubt.” – NY TIMES
