THE Lagos Police Command has described reports that over 20 suspects escaped from the detention facility of the disbanded Special Anti-Robbery Squad in Ikeja as “unfounded, mischievous and baseless.” Police spokesperson, Olumuyiwa Adejobi, who refuted the report, said it was an attempt to cause fear and panic among Lagosians and to also distract the Police. He said in a statement on Friday that in line with the directive of the Inspector-General of Police, Mohammed Adamu, the State Criminal Investigation Department, Yaba, had taken over the disbanded SARS, as well as other tactical units’ buildings in Ikeja and other satellite offices across the state, including the suspects. Adejobi said, “The attention of the Lagos State Command has been drawn to a rumour making waves on the social media that some suspects of the disbanded SARS escaped from the cell at the Command Headquarters, Ikeja, Lagos State on Wednesday. “The command perceives such rumour unfounded, mischievous and baseless. It is an attempt to cause fear and panic in the minds of Lagosians, and distracting the command.” He noted, “It is pertinent to state that some of the suspects, who have been convicted, have undergone COVID-19 test, which is a prerequisite to accepting them into correctional centres; but the command awaits their results before further actions. The suspects in all the cases handled by the disbanded SARS are intact. “The Deputy Commissioner of Police, State CID, Panti, Yaba, DCP Yetunde Longe, has temporarily relocated to the disbanded SARS building at Ikeja for thorough supervision and accountability of the taking over the process.” He said the Command, therefore, urged the public to regard the news “as a rumour, baseless and mischievous to suit the intention of the originator(s) as the command is committed to reforming the policing system and providing adequate security for all in the state.”
