POPULAR Nollywood actress, Chacha Eke Faani, has debunked reports that her marriage of seven years to Producer, Austin Faani, crashed as a result of domestic abuse. The pretty actress, in fact, said her husband had never laid his hands on her in all their years of marriage and revealed that she had been diagnosed of Bipolar disorder. Chacha had earlier announced on social media that her marriage to her husband had ended, saying she would tell the world her story at a later date. But in video recorded on a hospital bed, she said, “Five days ago, I made a video, saying that my marriage to Austin Faani is over and that video came with a lot of backlash from people with many insinuating that it was a clear case of domestic violence. It is not. “Austin has never laid his hands on me. Austin has never even raised his voice at me and God in heaven knows that’s the truth. “I’m here at First Delta American Hospital, Asaba, receiving treatment. Several psychiatrists have come to assess me mentally and I have been diagnosed of bipolar disorder. Bipolar is real. “Here in Africa, we tend not to know about it due to ignorance or overlook it. I cannot tell you all how I’ve been feeling in these tiny videos that I’ve been making but I will, however, show you motion pictures soon.”
