BY REBECCA AJANI THE Deputy Governor of Ondo State, Agboola Ajayi, has told the public to disregard a report that he is set to resign from office. He said the report to this effect in the media was false and a figment of the imagination of the writers. The deputy governor, who was the candidate of the Zenith Labour Party in the October 10, 2020 governorship election in Ondo State, spoke through his Media Adviser, Allen Sowore, in a statement on Monday. He said he was elected along with Governor Rotimi Akeredolu by the good people of Ondo State in 2016, noting that the four-year mandate given to both of them would not end until February 23, 2021. The statement said, “The news of his impending resignation is being sponsored by the governor through the propaganda machinery and machinations of Ondo State Ministry of Information as a subterfuge in preparation for a macabre plan to put the deputy governor’s forged signature on a prepared resignation letter. “The general public should be wary of these latest antics and desperation of the Governor to remove his Deputy by all means and at any cost illegally.” “The people of Ondo State, who voted for Agboola Ajayi as Deputy Governor in 2016, have not asked him to resign or quit the government. Therefore, he has no reason whatsoever to relinquish the people’s mandate, which of course is limited by term/time, democratically bestowed upon him,” Sowore declared. Ajayi lost the governorship election to Akeredolu of the All Progressives Congress. He came third, while Eyitayo Jegede of the Peoples Democratic Party got the second highest votes.
