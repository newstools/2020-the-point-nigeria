 AYO ESAN In continuation of the nationwide #EndSARS protests, protesters blocked major roads in Ibadan on Monday. Residents woke up as early as 5am and met brickwalls erected by protesters along major roads within Ibadan, the capital of Oyo State. This left the commuters with no option than trekking to their various destinations. Affected roads include Lagos-Ibadan Expressway toll gate, Molete, Challenge, Orita, New Garage, Apata, Dugbe, Ring Road, Gate, Iwo Road, Ogunpa market and other major markets and places across the city. Some of the protesters said that they were demanding a total police reform, noting that scrapping of SARS was not enough. The  protesters also used the occasion to  protest against outrageous electricity bills  by the Ibadan Electricity Distribution Company. The protesters stormed the Dugbe office of the IBEDC to register their dipleasure over the bills and demanded a reversal of the exorbitant bills. They carried various placards with inscriptions such as say “No to outrageous bil”, “IBEDC we reject your killing bill” and “We need prepaid meters”. Spokesman for the protesters against outrageous bill, Goke Ojo, noted that the estimated billing by IBDEC was exorbitant. He added that this was causing economic hardship for consumers. He urged the Federal Government to quickly attend to their demands.
