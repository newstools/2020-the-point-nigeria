REV Fr Solomon Ukeyima, the Parish Priest of St. Augustine Parish, Demekpe, in Makurdi, has said that one of the armed robbers that invaded the Parish House kept begging for forgiveness after picking each item in the house. “The robbers were calm throughout the operation. They kept begging for forgiveness. They did that throughout the period of the robbery,” Ukeyima told the News Agency of Nigeria in a telephone interview on Monday. “I love the confidence and the calmness in them. One of them, for anything he picked, he would say forgive us, Father,” he added. He said that the robbers invaded the Parish House around 2 a.m. on Monday and carted away several valuables. “The robbers demanded N5 million dollars from me, but I told them that I don’t have that kind of money. “I told them what I had and gave that to them,” he said. He said that the robbers appeared relaxed throughout the operation that lasted less than one hour, and spoke good English. He said that the robbers broke into his bedroom having scaled the perimeter fence to the Parish House and the window to the Priest’s parlour. According to him, they made away with proceeds of thanksgiving by four families, offertory, phones, selected footwear, sound system, and some drinks, amongst others. Ukeyima asked for prayers for the robbers to change from their evil ways, saying that he had since forgiven them. “I have forgiven them and I ask others to also pray for them. They are young people. There was one of them speaking impeccable English. “Let them make a complete u-turn and put to good use the talent that they have,” the priest said The Police Command in Benue confirmed the incident and vowed to apprehend the criminals. “The incident has been reported to us and we have begun an investigation,” DSP Catherine Anene, the command’s Public Relations Officer, told NAN. – NAN
