BY TIMOTHY AGBOR, OSOGBO GOVERNOR Gboyega Oyetola of Osun State and his convoy were on Saturday attacked by armed men at the #EndSARS protest ground in Osogbo. The #EndSARS protest had turned violent in Osogbo as hoodlums attacked the Governor and damaged several government vehicles while he was addressing protesters. Governor Oyetola had joined protesters in the walk from Alekuwodo area to Olaiya junction, singing with them and promising them that their demands would be looked into. He said he supported their peaceful agitations, which he said was part of the democratic process. However, while still addressing the youths, the armed men and women started shooting and hurling stones at the Governor’s car. Scores of yet to be identified people were severely injured as a stampede ensued shortly after the governor addressed the protesters. Some protesters who sustained severe injuries were rushed to Asubiaro State Hospital for medical attention. Before the protest was disrupted by the suspected thugs, Governor Oyetola had addressed the protesters where he assured them that all those who sustained any form of injuries during attacks on #EndSARS protesters would be taken care of by the state government. The Governor had been reprimanded by the protesters for not identifying with them publicly after about nine days of protest against Police brutality in the state before he was allowed to speak. Oyetola, who first apologised for not being able to address them since the protest started in the state assured the protesters that he believed in the genuine intention of the protest. He told the protesters that the Presidency had directed all state governors to constitute a judicial panel of inquiry to look into the SARS activities before it was disbanded. The atmosphere later became tense with the protesters not given any chance of peace. Suspected thugs started throwing dangerous objects at the Governor’s convoy, including the vehicle that scampered the Governor for safety.
