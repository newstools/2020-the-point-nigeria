THE Nigeria Customs Area Command, Kano State, has handed over one Sanusi Abdullahi Labaran to the Kano Zonal Office of the Economic and Financial Crimes Commission for further investigation. Labaran was arrested while attempting to smuggle 5,342 Automated Teller Machine cards out of the country. Custom Area Controller, Kano-Jigawa Command, Nasiru Ahmed, handed over the suspect, on Tuesday, to the Zonal Head of the EFCC Kano Office, Sanusi Aliyu Mohammed. He disclosed that the suspect was apprehended at the Mallam Aminu Kano International Airport by Customs Officers as he attempted to board an Ethiopian Airline to Dubai, United Arab Emirate. He further disclosed that a search conducted on the suspect yielded 5342 ATM cards bearing different names, which he concealed in a bag of beans. Also found on him were seven (7) pieces of memory cards and one (1) piece of SD card. The EFCC spokesperson, Wilson Uwujaren, in a statement, said that the suspect was handed over alongside the items recovered from him, including his travel documents and Dubai resident permit. The Zonal Head, while lauding the partnership between the two agencies, commended Customs for the arrest. He assured the agency that the EFCC would conduct a diligent investigation to unravel the mystery surrounding how the suspect came about the ATM cards as well as his mission to Dubai. “The Commission will leave no stone unturned in tracing the owners of the ATM cards and the reason behind the efforts he made to ship these ATM cards to Dubai,” Mohammed said.
