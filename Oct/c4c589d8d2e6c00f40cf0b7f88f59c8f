BY ADELEKE ADESANYA The Federal Government has ordered the deployment of more troops to Lagos. The soldiers are expected to secure public assets in Lagos, following the continuous attacks on private and public buildings by hoodlums. This is coming amid calls for Government to withdraw soldiers from the states. Governor Babajide Sanwo-Olu, who revealed this on a programme on Arise TV on Thursday, explained that the Chief of Defence Staff, Gen Abayomi Olonisakin; and the Chief of Army Staff, Lt Gen Tukur Buratai, spoke with him on the phone on Wednesday. He said the two security chiefs asked to deploy more troops to secure public assets in Lagos and he said, “Why not? Our airports and other public buildings must be secured.” There have been reports of widespread arson and violence in the past few days as rampaging hoodlums looted, razed and destroyed public and private assets. Sanwo-Olu had announced the imposition of a 24-hour state-wide curfew on Tuesday afternoon in the wake of the unrest in the state. Hoodlums, hiding under the cover of #EndSARS protests, have caused untold hardship and several deaths, across Nigeria. The attacks became more intense after peaceful #EndSARS protesters were shot at and killed at the Lekki Tollgate on Tuesday night. Banks, local government secretariats, police stations, the Palace of the Oba of Lagos, Shoprite Ajah, Head Office of the Nigerian Ports Authority, Sanwo-Olu’s mother’s house at Akerele, VIO/Federal Road Safety Corps’ offices at Ojodu, and the TVC office, among others, have been razed in the last 48 hours.
