 BY LINUS CHIBUIKE THE United Kingdom High Commission has reopened its visa application centres in Nigeria. This was disclosed in a statement by the UK on Twitter, a week after the centres were shut. The centres will, however, not open on Thursday, owing to the public holiday declared by the Federal Government to mark this year’s Maolud Nabiyy celebration. The UK had shut its Visa centres in Nigeria about six days ago, owing to the widespread violence that trailed the #EndSARS protests. The statement, titled, ‘Update on UK Visa application centres in Nigeria’, said, “Our TLS contact visa application centres are now open in Nigeria. Following the recent closures, we are working hard to process all outstanding applications. “We thank you for your continued patience and understanding. Please note Thursday, October 29, is a public holiday in Nigeria and our Visa application centres will be closed.”
