 … says scrapping of SARS not the best option THE Senate has ordered the arrest and prosecution of operatives of the Special Anti-Robbery Squad allegedly involved in the recent killings of innocent citizens across Nigeria. This followed a motion by Senator Oluremi Tinubu, which drew the attention of the lawmakers to the recent extra-judicial killings as well as abuse of human rights by operatives of SARS. Senate President Ahmad Lawan said overzealous and reckless operatives must be made to face the full wrath of the law, noting that a dismissal from service was not enough. He, however, added that scrapping the SARS at this point in time might be counterproductive. “Those who are involved in the recent killings of innocent Nigerians should be arrested and prosecuted. Scrapping the SARS now may not be the best option. The nation may lose the best hands in the agency while trying to do away with the bad eggs,” he said. He tasked the Senate Committee on Police, Judiciary and Human Rights to carry out an investigation of abuse of human rights of Nigerians by the SARS operatives in the last few years.
