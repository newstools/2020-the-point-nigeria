PRESIDENT Muhammadu Buhari has directed the Inspector-General of Police, Mohammad Adamu, to address the concerns of Nigerians regarding the excesses of the Special Anti-Robbery Squad, in view of the protests across Nigeria. The protests have been going on nationwide for over 72 hours. In a Twitter statement late Friday night, the President expressed his determination to reform the Police Force and ensure that the operatives were fully accountable to Nigerians. Buhari said, “The IG already has my firm instructions to conclusively address the concerns of Nigerians regarding these excesses and ensure erring personnel are brought to justice. I appeal for patience and calm, even as Nigerians freely exercise their right to peacefully make their views known. “The vast majority of men and women of the Nigeria Police Force are patriotic and committed to protecting the lives and livelihoods of Nigerians, and we will continue to support them to do their job.”
