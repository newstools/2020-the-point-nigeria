BY TIMOTHY AGBOR, OSOGBO Following cases of suspected protest hijack nationwide, members of the Hunters Group of Nigeria, Osun State Chapter, on Tuesday, declared support to #EndSARS protesters in Osogbo and promised to ward off hoodlums that may hijack the demonstrations. Operatives of the Nigeria Police have not been seen around the protest scenes since the demonstrations against the Special Anti-Robbery Squad began. Armed with guns and other weapons, the hunters stormed the protest ground at Olaiya area of Osogbo around 1:20pm and declared their support to the struggle. Adorned in their uniform and led by their leader, Nureni Adisa, who was wearing a protective armour dotted with charms, the protesters vowed to quell any incursion of hoodlums into the protest. Addressing the protesters, Adisa said their presence at the protest scenes and around Osogbo was to ensure civility, orderliness and security of lives and property of the people of the capital city. He condemned the attack on Governor Gboyega Oyetola of the state by some political thugs last weekend and charged the protesters to be at alert and ensure that any miscreant that might want to infiltrate them was identified. Reacting, the spokesperson of the protesters, Adebisi Oluwaseun Emmanuel, explained how crisis ensued at the protest scene at Olaiya while Oyetola was addressing protesters. He promised to ensure that the protest was not hijacked and called on the governor to bring those who attacked protesters last week to justice.
