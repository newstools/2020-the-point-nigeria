THE Peoples Democratic Party’s governorship candidate, Eyitayo Jegede, on Saturday said that he was sure of emerging victorious in the governorship election in Ondo State. Jedege spoke with newsmen shortly after he cast his vote at Ward 2, Unit 9 at Sacred Heart Primary School in Akure. Jedege, who waited for about 30 minutes on queue before the card reader could clear him to vote, expressed dissatisfaction over the malfunctioning of the card reader. He urged the Independent National Electoral Commission (INEC) to put more efforts into making the card readers to work perfectly well to enable the electorate to cast their votes. Earlier, there was a downpour but thousands of prospective voters defied it and waited at their polling units to cast their votes. Jegede who arrived his polling unit for accreditation and voting in company with his wife, Eno Jegede, expressed delight with the large turnout of voters. The PDP’s candidate declined the offer to cast his vote ahead of intending voters he met on a long queue. “I won’t vote ahead of the people I met here. These people left some other duties to come and perform their civic responsibilities. “Nobody is above the law and we must lay good examples to enhance the true democratic culture,” he said. – NAN
