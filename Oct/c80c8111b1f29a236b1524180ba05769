BY FOLASHADE KEHINDE THE #EndSARS protests have turned bloody in Lagos as security operatives fired gunshots sporadically at the Lekki Tollgate on Tuesday night. Governor Babajide Sanwo-Olu had imposed a 24-hour curfew from 4pm on Tuesday in view of the violent turn the protests had taken in the state. The protesters at Lekki, however, defied the curfew and remained on the protest ground. As of the time of filing this report, several persons have been reportedly killed while many other sustained injuries. The Inspector-General of Police, Mohammed Adamu, had on Tuesday deployed anti-riot policemen nationwide to address the crisis that emanated from the protests. Watch video. Video Player
