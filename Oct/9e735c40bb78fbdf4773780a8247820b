The Point had reported that the infiltration of the #EndSARS protests by hoodlums continued to take an ugly dimension as miscreants, on Saturday, invaded the residence of the lawmaker representing the Oyo Central Senatorial District in the National Assembly, Senator Teslim Folarin, carting away hundreds of motorcycles, popularly called Okada. Properties worth millions of naira were also reportedly stolen from the Senator’s House, located at the Oluyole area of Ibadan, Oyo State. On the same day, hoodlums had stormed the residence of former Deputy Speaker Lasun Yusuf, in Osun State, including shops and Tuns Farm, among others, carting away goods and other properties. It was the same story in parts of Lagos, where houses of lawmakers were burgled without check. The IGP however directed the police chiefs to take charge and save the country from criminal elements masquerading as protesters in some parts of the country. A statement by the spokesperson for the Police Force, DCP Frank Mba, titled, “Reclaim the public space and restore normalcy,  IG orders AIGs, CPs, CPs, others”, said Adamu gave the responsibility of restoring order to all Assistant Inspectors -General of Police, Commissioners of Police, heads of police operational Units, Squadron and Base Commanders in charge of Zonal/State/FCT Commands, the Police Mobile Force, Counter-Terrorism Unit and the Special Protection Unit, on October 24, 2020. “In addition, CPs and heads of police formations in the various states had also been charged to mobilise their men and work in sync with the command CPs in the areas where they are domiciled, to dominate the public space and ensure peace and safety in the affected areas,” Mba noted.
