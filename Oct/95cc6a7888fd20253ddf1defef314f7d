RESIDENTS of Abakaliki, the Ebonyi State capital, are currently running helter shelter for safety as unknown gun men have invaded the state, shooting sporadically. The yet to be identified gunmen, through their activities, virtually brought Abakaliki to a halt, and scared traders away at the popular Kpirikpiri Market. All petrol stations have been closed in the area, including private businesses, as the hoodlums fired gunshots continuously. Police Public Relations Officer in the state, DSP Loveth Odah, in a phone interview, however, debunked rumours that the police station at Kpirikpiri Division was on fire. According to her, at that moment, no police property was torched except a car parked in front of the station, which she noted was set on fire. “Apart from a vehicle parked in front of the Police station at kpirikpiri, no other Police facility was touched. And the owner has yet to be ascertained,” she said. There is, however, a yet to be confirmed report that there was an attempted prison break at the Abakaliki Correctional Centre. When The Point contacted the state Corrections PRO, Nneka Ayiya, she promised to brief our correspondent later.
