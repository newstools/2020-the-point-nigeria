BY REBECCA AJANI THE infiltration of the #EndSARS protests by hoodlums has continued to take an ugly dimension as miscreants, on Saturday, invaded the residence of the lawmaker representing the Oyo Central Senatorial District in the National Assembly, Senator Teslim Folarin, carting away hundreds of motorcycles, popularly called Okada. Properties worth millions of naira were also reportedly stolen from the Senatorâ€™s House, located at the Oluyole area of Ibadan, Oyo State. A video that has gone viral showed the hoodlums rushing into the house, and hurrying out with brand new motorcycles, and calling on passers-by to also go and get theirs. The miscreants, who were said to have broken through the windows and entrance doors, had a field day, as no security operatives made it to the house to disperse them or effect arrests. The development was confirmed by the affected senator during a telephone interview with Fresh 105.9FM. According to Folarin, about 300 motorcycles were carted away, including food items and other household utensils, which were supposed to be used for the empowerment of his people. He, however, said he was grateful to God that no life was lost in the incident. The Oyo State Police Command confirmed the incident, saying investigations had commenced on the matter.
