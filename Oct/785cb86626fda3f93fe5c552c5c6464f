CHEVRON Nigeria Limited will reduce its workforce by 25 per cent, owing to a review of its manpower requirement, the company said on Friday. The company said the move became necessary to increase efficiency, retain value, reduce cost and generate more revenue for the Federal Government of Nigeria. This was disclosed in a statement on Friday, titled, “Chevron Nigeria Limited reviews workforce in accordance with business exigencies”, signed the company’s General Manager, Policy, Government and Public Affairs, Esimaje Brikinn. The company, however, said employees would retain their jobs until the completion of the reorganisation process. The statement said, “The aim is to have a business that is competitive and has an appropriately sized organisation with improved processes. “This will increase efficiency and effectiveness, retain value, reduce cost, and generate more revenue for the Federal Government of Nigeria. “It is important to note that all our employees will retain their employment until the reorganisation process is completed. “We have prospects for our company in Nigeria; however, we must make the necessary adjustments in light of the prevailing business climate; and we need everyone’s support to get through these tough times stronger, more efficient and more profitable, in order to sustain the business.” “We are actively engaging our workforce to ensure they understand why this is being done. We will continue to consistently engage all relevant stakeholders, including the leadership of the employee unions as we continue this process of business optimisation,” Chevron Nigeria noted.
