COMMISSIONER for Information and Orientation in Ondo State, Donald Ojogo, has said the public should disregard a viral video, which claimed that some people were shot in the polling unit where Governor Rotimi Akeredolu of the All Progressives Congress, and his wife, Betty voted. Ojogo said in a statement that the video was an attempt by the opposition to discredit the Saturday governorship poll in Ondo State, noting that the allegation was to wade off “the tension of an imminent defeat.” He said, “The public is hereby enjoined to disregard a puerile attempt by the opposition to discredit the electoral process that some people were shot at the polling unit where Governor Akeredolu voted. “This is another failed effort to hang on spurious allegations to wade off the tension of an imminent defeat.” Channels TV has since disowned the video, saying it is fake and does not represent what is currently happening in the state. The video, which went viral on Saturday, had indicated that the wife of the incumbent Governor Rotimi Akeredolu of the All Progressives Congress had been injured during a fracas involving his boys and voters, while three people were killed.
