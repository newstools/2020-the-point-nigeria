BY ADELEKE ADESANYA THERE is palpable fear in Fagba, Iju-Ishaga, Ifako-Ijaiye Local Government Area of Lagos State, as Hausa and Yoruba youths have engaged each other in a fight that has claimed many properties. Our correspondent gathered that the crisis had resulted in the burning of some houses in the area. It was gathered that the crisis started when some hoodlums attacked some trucks containing livestocks belonging to some Hausa men and carted away some of the animals. The incident, a resident said, led to a reprisal attack on some Yoruba people in the area by the Hausa youths. A resident, who confirmed the development to our correspondent on phone, Tokunbo Adebanjo, said, “I learnt two trucks belonging to Hausa men were hijacked by hoodlums, and that caused crisis between Hausa and Yoruba youths.” Another resident, Tunji, said, “I am not currently in that area, but I have called my people at home and they said they had locked themselves in the house because of the unrest in the area. They said the area was boiling with crisis triggered by the youths.” Meanwhile, an unconfirmed report said one person had been killed in the crisis with many houses were burnt. The Lagos Police Public Relations Officer, Muyiwa Adejobi, said police had been drafted to the area to restore peace. He said, “The police are on top of the situation. The crisis has an ethnic colouration. Two trucks belonging to the Hausa people were attacked and that led to the crisis. “We have been talking to the Hausa people for peace to reign, but these hoodlums are still disturbing them and the Hausas in defence are trying to fight back.  But we are on top of the situation to restore peace and normality.”
