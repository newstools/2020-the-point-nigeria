A 12-year-old girl has been left paralysed after a gang of two men raped her at Egan, Igando area of Lagos. The victim, a Junior Secondary School Three student, was said to have been lured into a hotel on her street where she was raped. She was reported to have met one of the rapists on a social media platform long before the incident. It was gathered that one of the suspects who perpetrated the evil, identified as Mustapha Tohib, also known as “Small” was arrested by the Police at Igando when some residents trooped to the division over the matter. A resident of the area, who simply identified himself as Gbenga, told The Point, “I leant that one of the fleeing gang members, identified as Sunkanmi, a mechanic and former student of Edu Grammar School, who lives at Ita Alhaji Street, Ikotun, booked a room in the hotel where they raped the girl. “According to what I heard, after getting the hotel room, his partner, “Small” sneaked into the victim’s house and lured her into the hotel where they took turns on her until she started bleeding profusely. “When they saw that she was bleeding, they had to drop her close to her house at night where people finally saw her in a pool of blood.” Meanwhile, the arrested suspect, Small, said he and his accomplice did not meet the victim as a virgin. He also claimed to have established contact with the victim long before the incident.
