THE Federal Government has warned that it will not allow the country to be thrown into anarchy following the violence that has trailed the #EndSARS protests. The Minister of Information and Culture, Alhaji Lai Mohammed, stated this on Saturday when he featured on a late-night Nigeria Television Authority news programme, “Weekend File”. The programme was entitled, “EndSARS Protest: The Way Forward”. The minister said the protests had been hijacked by hoodlums and people with ulterior agenda. He noted that while the original conveners of the protests might have meant well, it was obvious that they were no longer in control of the initiative. “Peaceful protest is an integral part of democracy and that is why the Federal Government in the last 11 days has treated the protesters in a very civilised manner. “But, if you look at what happened to the governor of Osun State, it has gone completely beyond peaceful protest against excesses and abuse of power by the police. “There is nowhere in the world where a government will fold its arms and allow the country to descend into anarchy. “We are no longer dealing with #EndSARS but a volatile situation that can lead to anarchy if the government does not take some very firm steps to protect the lives and livelihood of innocent Nigerians,” he said. The minister added that the protests had gone beyond being peaceful because lives had been lost and innocent Nigerians, including workers and students, were passing through harrowing experiences. Specifically, he said because the protesters were blocking the roads and highway, workers were finding it difficult to get to their offices and back home while many Nigerians were stranded on the roads. “We have nothing against peaceful protest but there are civilised ways of doing so. “This is by going to a venue where you are not going to disturb other Nigerians because where your own right stops, other persons’ rights begin,” he said. – NAN
