BY YEMI SOLEBO THE Kogi State Police Command has arrested a Pastor, Sunday Edino, over the looting and vandalisation of medical equipment estimated to worth N1.2bn. The Kogi-based pastor and his accomplices were, on Monday, arrested with medical equipment in Lokoja by the Commissioner of Police in the state, Ede Ayuba, and his officers, during a manhunt launched to track hoodlums who had invaded a Kogi warehouse. The hoodlums had looted and vandalised the N1.2bn worth medical equipment at the warehouse. The miscreants also stormed the Agricultural Development Project office along the Lokoja-Okene Road, where they looted agrochemicals and fertilisers, among others, meant to help farmers during the dry season. The hoodlums were also said to have broken into another warehouse in the state and carted away roofing sheets, mattresses, and beddings, among other materials meant for victims of flood disaster. The Point had reported that Governor Yahaya Bello of Kogi State said, on Monday, that the disbandment of the Special Anti-Robbery Squad dampened the moral of police operatives and sent them away from the streets. Bello said this was the major cause of the lawlessness and looting witnessed across various parts of the country in the past few days. Speaking on Channels Television Sunrise Programme, the Governor said, while no one faulted the motive behind the #EndSARS protests, the scrapping of SARS pushed the police officers to abandon their jobs. He said, “Now that SARS has ended, police morale has been dampened; they have gone off the streets, and the hoodlums have taken to the streets. Who do we report to?”
