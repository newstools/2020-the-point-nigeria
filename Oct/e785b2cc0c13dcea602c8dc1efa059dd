A Group within the Lagos Peoples Democratic Party, PDP Democrats, has called on Nigerians to ignore the outburst of former Governor of Ekiti State, Ayodele  Fayose, describing him as “a confused dreamer.” Fayose had, on Tuesday, accused Governor Seyi Makinde of Oyo State and former Deputy National Chairman of the PDP, Bode George, of sponsoring the attack carried out on him by some youths who removed his cap at a campaign rally in Ondo State. The Group in a statement signed by its Chairman, Tajudeen Abinuwaye, said, “In an unguarded and unthoughtful outburst, Fayose hurriedly jumped into conclusion, whipping up emotion about his encounter with some youths in Ondo State who allegedly removed his cap at the grand finale of the PDP rally. “Fayose openly apologised to all the people he had wronged, right at the podium in his very brief remarks. It is rather shocking and outrageous for this same person to change swiftly and start pointing accusing fingers at his phantom enemies.” “Fayose has been known to have been reckless and abusive towards elders. He had once maligned and openly abused former President Obasanjo, Chief Afe Babalola, Chief Bode George and even President Muhammadu Buhari,” the group added. The PDP member added that Fayose had “constantly displayed an attitude of a man pursued by some inner demon. He needs a definite purgation. His careless, indifferent outbursts should be discountenanced.”
