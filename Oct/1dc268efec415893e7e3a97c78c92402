 SALIU SALIU THE Appeal Division of the Kano State High Court, on Monday, adjourned the hearing of the appeal challenging a judgement of the Shariah Court, which sentenced Sharrif Yahaya, to death by hanging and Umar Farouq to 10 years imprisonment, till November 26, 2020. Yahaya, 30 years old, and Farouq, 17, had been sentenced by the Shariah Court, sitting in Hausawa Filin Hockey, Kano State, for blasphemy against Prophet Muhammad and making a derogatory statement against Almighty Allah, respectively. One of the lawyers of the two defendants, Kola Alanipini, had filed a suit on their behalf before the Kano State High Court to appeal the judgment. The appellants, who were, however, absent in court on Monday, sought for an adjournment, citing civil unrest, which had prevented them from being available. Moreover, they said, through their representative, that they were served on short notice. Justice Nuraddeen Sagir granted their requests and adjourned the case until November 26, 2020, saying, “The court is aware of the unrest in Lagos, and as a result of this, adjourns till 26th November, 2020. The respondents shall also serve the appellant in good time.”
