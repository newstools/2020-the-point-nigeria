BY FOLASHADE KEHINDE AMERICAN music star, Janet Jackson, has joined many international celebrities in supporting the Nigerian youths’ protests against police brutality, extra-judicial killings and bad governance. In a series of tweets, she commended the #EndSARS protesters, describing them as young, brave, future leaders. The singer said, “To the powerful people of Nigeria, especially to the young, brave, future leaders who have stood fearlessly in the face of corruption and greed, I stand with you. “For all those who refuse to remain chained to another generation of suffering, I pray to God for your justice and liberation. Enough is truly enough. Nigeria is a land of love, beauty, culture, and pride but those who have chosen to murder and brutalise have brought shame to this great nation. “Your time is up. Nigeria I pray for you and I love you so much. #EndSARS #LekkiMassacre #EndPoliceBrutality.”
