A former presidential aspirant on the platform of the All Progressives Congress, Adamu Garba, has threatened to sue Twitter CEO, Jack Dorsey, for allegedly supporting the #EndSARS protests in Nigeria. Adamu described Dorsey’s tweet, supporting the protests as a needless interference, considering the political slant he said the protests had assumed. According to him, endorsing a link for donation to the #EndSARS cause is capable of pushing the situation beyond Nigeria’s overstretched security management, The Point reports. Twitter CEO had on Wednesday night indicated support for #EndSARS protesters via his handle. He had retweeted a message from the Feminist Coalition, educating people on ways of making contributions, saying, “Donate via Bitcoin to help #EndSARS.” But the former APC Presidential aspirant said, “Dear @jack, It’ll do you a lot more good if you stay away from Nigerian Politics. You should know that the so-called #EndSARS protests have transformed into political agitation, capable of breaking law & order in our country. You should not be a moral & financial sponsor to this. “I can see you are even sharing a link for people to donate money for this protest, an event capable of escalation beyond our already overstretched security management. If this protest continued to evolved into disorder (hopefully not). As a Nigerian citizen, we’ll meet in court:”
