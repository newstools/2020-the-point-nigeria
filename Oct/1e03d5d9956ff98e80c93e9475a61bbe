BY LINUS CHIBUIKE THE brother of Oke Obi-Enadhuze, who created a blood bank app, has said, contrary to media reports, his brother was stabbed to death by hoodlums and not killed by a stray bullet. Daniel, the brother of the deceased, said he was stabbed by hoodlums who had invaded the Makinde Police Station, beside the police barracks where their family resided. He said the hoodlums had overpowered the policemen after hours of gun battle and set the station on fire, adding that they, thereafter, stormed the barracks and began to loot homes. According to him, their mother’s two cars were burnt in the incident. The thugs allegedly stabbed Oke in the neck when he was trying to persuade them to take everything but spare their lives. He narrated the family’s ordeal via his Twitter handle @DanielOE16. Daniel said, “I, my brother and mother lived at Makinde police barracks, Mafoluku, Oshodi, Lagos State. Today at about 11 o’clock in the morning, the police station at Makinde was attacked by thugs who wanted to destroy the station, I, my mum and brother were holed up in our house. “The attack went on for hours before the thugs eventually breached the police and proceeded to set the station on fire, after accomplishing this, they set their sights to the barracks and began the assault. They proceeded to destroy every car in the barracks; my mum’s two cars were destroyed and set on fire and then they infiltrated our house by breaking the door. “They then proceeded to ransack the house and carted away everything we own. My brother on trying to get them to take everything but spare us was pushed to my mom’s room and stabbed on the neck. The attacker then proceeded to attack me but missed my neck but got my chin instead.”
