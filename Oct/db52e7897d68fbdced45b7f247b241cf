BY FOLASHADE KEHINDE THE Criterion, an association of Women in Business and Professions, has condemned, in strong terms, “the barbaric shooting of unarmed and peaceful protesters at Lekki tollgate on Tuesday night. The Association, in a press statement, issued by its International Amirah, Hajia Fatymah Oyefeso, also called for thorough investigation into circumstances surrounding the attack with a view to bringing the perpetrators and masterminds of the dastardly act to book. “This will in no small measure douse the tension of the protesters and help the grieving families of the victims get justice,” Oyefeso noted. She said, “The Federal Government should constitute a Judicial Probe Panel to investigate the incident, bring the perpetrators to book and see that justice is served appropriately. “What began as a peaceful protest was hijacked by hoodlums, resulting in the loss of lives and wanton destruction of properties. There is palpable fear across the country.” According to her, The Criterion is particularly concerned because in times of war and civil unrest, women and children are always at the receiving end. The Amirah therefore called for a thorough investigation into the ill-advised act of shooting at protesters at the Lekki tollgate and other parts of the country with a view to bringing perpetrators to book. She noted that, though President Muhammadu Buhari had addressed the nation on the #EndSARS protests, the genuine demands of protesters, prior to the struggle being hijacked by hoodlums, should not be swept aside. The Criterion said, “We wish to sympathise with all the victims of the protest and those who might have suffered any loss and untold hardship during the protest and the avoidable violence that followed. “We call on our resilient youth to remain calm while government carries out its investigations. We pray that Almighty Allah restores peace and harmony in the land. Long live our dear country Nigeria.”
