 SENATE President Ahmad Lawan has declared that many of the aides of President Muhammadu Buhari will not be allowed into the Chamber during the presentation of the 2021 Appropriation Bill to a joint session of the National Assembly on Thursday. He linked the decision of the NASS to the need to comply fully with COVID-19 protocols, noting that those who would be shut out could join the presentation virtually. This, in effect, means that Ministers, top aides of the President, Governors, and key All Progressives Congress chieftains, who usually accompanied Buhari for such presentations might not be allowed to do so this time. While noting that the presentation would last for about an hour, the Senate President said, “The joint session normally takes place in the chamber of the House of Representatives. “It is going to be the same. It will take place there but this time around, because of COVID-19, we have made arrangements to observe social distancing in the Chamber. We also have to wear our face masks mandatorily. We will abridge the entire event because we will be many there.” He added, “The entire event will last just about an hour. From the entry of the President into the chamber, to the addresses and the presentation, will be just an hour event, so that we can comply with the requirements of the COVID-19 protocol. “Mr. President too, this time around, will not be accompanied by many people on the entourage. Only a few people, very key and relevant to budget, will accompany Mr. President into the Chamber. Those that have little to do with the budget will join virtually.”
