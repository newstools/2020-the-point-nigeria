 LINUS CHIBUIKE THE Upper Area Court, Kubwa, Abuja, has granted Maryam Sherif, the ex-wife of Atiku Abubakar, custody of their three sons with immediate effect. Abubakar, son of former Vice President of Nigeria and candidate of the Peoples Democratic Party in the 2019 election, Alhaji Atiku Abubakar, is to hand over the three children to his divorced wife, according to the judgment. The estranged wife had instituted a case against the younger Atiku Abubakar at the Upper Area Court, Gudu, seeking the court to grant her custody of their three sons. The case was later transferred to the Upper Area Court, Kubwa. Delivering judgment, the Judge, Hon Bashir Danmaisule, said the defendant (Abubakar) could not establish any default against the claimant to deprive her of her children under the Islamic law, noting that there was room for an appeal within the next 30 days. Both Abubakar and his lawyer, Abdullahi Hassan, were not in court. But his divorced wife and her lawyer, Nasir Saidu, were present.
