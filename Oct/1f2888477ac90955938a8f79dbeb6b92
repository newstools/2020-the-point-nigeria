 LINUS CHIBUIKE THE wife of the President, Aisha Buhari, has joined the calls for an end to oppression, police brutality and insecurity in Nigeria. Aisha, on Saturday, indicated her desire for President Muhammadu Buhari and service chiefs to save Nigerians through a video she tweeted. She attached a caption, “Save the People” to a video of a meeting Buhari held with service chiefs, which she tweeted on Saturday. Save the People was communicated in Hausa language as #Achechijamaa. The tweet was also accompanied by a background song in Hausa. “Please look at our condition. We need your help. The North is crying. There is insincerity. Our blood is being spilled. Our property is being destroyed. Intervene in our situation, baba,” the song said. Aisha Buhari is known for her pro-people stance on many issues of national importance, an attribute that has endeared her to Nigerians across socio-political and ethnic divides, The Point reports. The #EndSARS protests have continued with greater intensity across the country. In Abuja, the protesters ignored the notice of a ban on their activities by the Federal Capital Territory Administration. The Point had reported that despite the statement by the Administration banning the protests, owing to the violation of COVID-19 protocols, the protesters stormed the National Assembly Complex on Thursday, to further press home their demands and continued their protests on Friday through Saturday. Thugs have also attacked peaceful protesters, killing about five people in Lagos, Osun and Edo states. In Osun, no fewer than two persons were reportedly killed during the #EndSARS protest that rocked Osogbo, Osun State capital on Saturday. Several others were severely injured when some armed hoodlums stormed the protest ground around 5:00pm. The State Governor, Gboyega Oyetola, and his convoy were also attacked by the armed thugs that stormed the EndSARS protest ground while the Governor was addressing the protesters.
