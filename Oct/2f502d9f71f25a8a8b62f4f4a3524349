MEMBERS of the #RevolutionNow movement have accused operatives of the Department of State Services of confiscating their phones, money and other belongings when 11 of their members were arrested during a peaceful protest against what they described as harsh policies implemented by the President Muhammadu Buhari-led administration. The prostesters claimed that DSS operatives brutalised their members before seizing their belongings. Those arrested were later released at the DSS office. One of the protesters who was arrested said that they were pushed out of the DSS’ vehicles as the operatives took two of their phones, money, placards and other equipment. The protesters under the Coalition of Revolution (CORE) movement, while addressing journalists, said that they were also beaten by the heavily armed operatives. The officials of the secret police had been on the trail of the protesters when they gathered at the Old Garage area of Osogbo on Thursday morning. The protesters, who later gathered at the popular Olaiya to continue their protest against the state of the nation, were dispersed, arrested and allegedly brutalised by the DSS. Speaking for the group, Owoeye Olaoluwa, a member of Take it Back Movement, Nigeria, condemned the recent hike in the price of petrol and electricity tariff and called for their reversal. He said, “We are here to demand no two things. We are here to say that the porous regime of Buhari should resign with immediate effect, and we are not calling for it with double-minded hearts. “We are calling for immediate resignation because we cannot continue with this act of indiscipline; we cannot continue with this act of corruption. We cannot continue with this act of fuel hike; we cannot continue with this act of electricity hike. “We are saying immediate and unconditional release of the materials that have been taken such as our phones, money.”
