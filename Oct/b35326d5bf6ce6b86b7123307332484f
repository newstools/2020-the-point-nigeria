 AYO ESAN THE Centre for Anti-Corruption And Open Leadership has described the ongoing #EndSARS protests across the nation as a wake up call to leaders to know that when pushed to the wall, Nigerians would react and anti-people policies would be strongly opposed. Speaking with The Point, Executive  Chairman, CACOL, Debo Adeniran, said the protest started with the demand for the proscription of SARS and some other ancillary demands, but added that so many issues must be addressed. But he quickly added that Nigerians could not afford to allow the protests to ground socio-economic activities, considering the fact that most people are just trying to get their balance after the COVID-19 lockdown. He said, “Though, the Government has acceded to those demands but the youth are still on the streets. They’re now making other demands they believe would make Nigeria a better place to live in. “I  believe the whole apparatus of the Police needs reform; I also believe that there are so many issues that need to be addressed just as these youth are agitating. “It’s good that for the first time, our youth are waking up to demand for good governance and other issues that affect the entire populace.” Adeniran said one of the implications  of the protest was that “we may have more of these protests in the future, especially when policies of government are not consistent with the reality on ground.” He said the best the government could do now was to dialogue with the representatives of these youth. “It’s a pity that the protests are now assuming violent dimensions. We cannot afford to allow these protests to ground the socio-economic activities of our people, knowing full well that most people are just trying to get their balance after the COVID-19 lockdown. The government needs to show more seriousness and commitment in handling the issues raised by these protesters,” he stated.
