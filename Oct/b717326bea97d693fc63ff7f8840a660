 BY AGNES NWORIE, ABAKALIKI Following the violence that has marred the #EndSARS protests across Nigeria, the Ebonyi State Government has postponed the 2020 First School Leaving Certificate Examinations in the state. In a statement in Abakaliki, the Ebonyi State Commissioner for Education, Onyebuchi Chima, explained that the examination, previously scheduled to take place on Saturday, October 31, 2020 for all primary 6 pupils in state, had been postponed in order to guarantee safety of the pupils. Chima, who said that new date would soon be made public, advised parents and head teachers to use this period of postponement to ensure that their wards/pupils were registered for the examination, especially in Afikpo South Local Government Area where he said not even one pupil had been registered. The Commissioner announced Monday, November 2, 2020, as resumption date for the 2020/2021 academic session in Ebonyi State.
