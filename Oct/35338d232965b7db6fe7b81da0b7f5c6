THE Minister of Youth and Sports Development, Sunday Dare, and the Soun of Ogbomoso, Oba Oladunni Oyewumi, narrowly escaped death in the hands of some hoodlums that invaded the palace to disrupt a stakeholders meeting on Sunday evening. The incident, which took all by surprise, also affected the chiefs in the palace who were caught unawares. It took the efforts of security men to rescue the traditional ruler and other chiefs at the meeting, it was learnt. Some unconfirmed reports said some youths had gone to the palace to protest the death of a student allegedly killed by police two days ago during the EndSARS protest before hoodlums hijacked the protests. While confirming the incident, the minister said the hoodlums destroyed properties in the palace during their invasion. The minister who spoke on his Twitter handle said, “Ogbomoso – Hoodlums, thugs and miscreants distrupt stakeholders meeting in Soun’s palace now – invading, stoning and breaking doors, glasses. Soun, myself and council chiefs were scurried into safety by the police and Department of State Services. “The hoodlums broke into the palace and destroyed chairs, overturned tables, broke windows. These were not youth or students. These were miscreants and thugs who saw a window of opportunity in the protest which (was) since abated. Thankfully, Soun, the chiefs, leaders of Parapo are safe.” “Ogbomoso youths are law-abiding. But hoodlums have taken over. A combined team of Operation Burst from Ibadan and a unit from Iliorin are now on ground in Ogbomoso to help keep the peace, protect the peaceful and innocent and also stop criminal elements. Soun of Ogbomosho yesterday and today personally appealed to this group to stop violence,” he added.
