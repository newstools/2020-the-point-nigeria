GOVERNOR Simon Lalong of Plateau State has announced a 24-hour curfew in Jos, North and South, with effect from 8pm on Tuesday, October 20, 2020. This curfew order is coming on the heels of violence that has marred the ongoing #EndSARS protests in Jos, the state capital. There has been violence in the two local governments where 10 vehicles were reportedly burnt, while hoodlums also looted shops in the area. The governments of Lagos and Ekiti states have also imposed a state-wide curfew in their states. Details laterâ€¦
