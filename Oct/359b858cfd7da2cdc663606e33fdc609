 FOLASHADE KEHINDE THE Lagos State Government has ordered the indefinite closure of public and private schools in the state. The Head, Public Affairs, Ministry of Education, Kayode Abayomi, made the disclosure in a statement on Monday. The statement, titled, ‘Lagos directs students to stay at home’, quoted the Commissioner for Education, Folasade Adefisayo, as saying that the schools were shut down over tension generated by the ongoing anti-SARS protests. The statement said, “The Lagos State Government has directed all pupils/students in public and private schools to stay at home following the tension generated by the anti-SARS protests. “A new date of resumption for all classes will be announced as soon as possible.” Governor Babajide Sanwo-Olu had, earlier in the day, begged protesters to leave the streets and allow Government to meet their demands, while indicating that schools might have to be shut. “The safety of the pupils/students, parents and all staff working in schools is paramount at this critical period,” the Commissioner said, while advising parents not to allow their children be used as willing tools in the hands of those who might want to hijack the protests. Schools could utilise other means of distance teaching and learning such as radio, television and online media, the state government said.
