 BY REBECCA AJANI SOME unions at the University of Ibadan, on Wednesday, shut the two gates of the institution to protest what they described as a planned imposition of the Deputy Vice Chancellor, Prof. Kayode Adebowale, as the Vice Chancellor. The protesting workers, believed to be members of the Non-Academic Staff Union of the University, blocked all the entrances and forced visitors, staff and students, to park their vehicles outside and trek all the way to their destinations. A lecturer who spoke with our correspondent alleged that the VC was planning to impose Adebowale as his successor and that members of staff were ready to resist it. The lecturer, who spoke in confidence, said protesting workers would not mind to cripple activities in the institution if the VC went ahead with his plan. Our correspondent observed that the workers were chanting solidarity songs and carrying placards with various inscriptions like: “impose Adebowale and shut down UI for six years”, among others. Eighteen candidates, it was learnt, showed interest in the VC position. Six were shortlisted by the five-man panel. The shortlisted candidates are Adebowale, Prof. Olusegun Ademowo, Prof. Ebenezer Farombi, Prof. Abideen Aderinto, Prof. Babatunde Salako and Prof. Femi Mimiko.
