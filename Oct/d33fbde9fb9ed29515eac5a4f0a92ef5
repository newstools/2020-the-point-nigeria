…says website not hacked AYO ESAN The Economic and Financial Crimes Commission has disowned an #EndSARS protester who said he resigned from the Commission to join the protests. The EFCC said categorically that the lawyer, Dominic Akpan, was never a staff of the Commission, noting that he only served as a National Youth Service Corp member in its Port Harcourt office for about one year. It urged members of the public, in a statement on Monday, to disregard the report, including the one that said its website had been hacked. “Though there were attempts, over the weekend, to compromise the website by some cyber criminals, the attacks were successfully repelled,” the EFCC said, noting that its website was up and running. The Commision said its “attention has been drawn to a report trending in the social media regarding a certain Dominic Akpan, who claims to have resigned from the employ of the Commission to join the #EndSARS Movement. He cited undisclosed ‘ugly experiences’ he had within the Commission for his action.” It said, “He merely served as a National Youth Service Corps member in the Port Harcourt zonal office of the Commission from November 2019 to October 16, 2020 when he completed his national service. “He therefore could not have resigned from the EFCC to join the #EndSARS Movement.” The EFCC stressed that the stunt by Akpan was nothing but crass opportunism. “And seeking to achieve his selfish objectives riding on the crest of the popular protests by the youth, clamouring for institutional reform in Nigeria, is a disservice to the EndSARS Movement,” the Commission added.
