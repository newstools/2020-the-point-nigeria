BY LINUS CHIBUIKE THE Independent National Electoral Commission has postponed senatorial and state bye-elections earlier scheduled to hold in 11 states. INEC said the 15 elections, which should have held in six senatorial districts and nine state constituencies, on October 30, had been postponed, owing to the current security situation. A statement by the Spokesperson for INEC, Festus Okoye, on Thursday, said, “This decision is in compliance with Section 26 (2) of the Electoral Act 2010 (as amended), which gives the commission the power to postpone an election if there is reason to believe that a serious breach of the peace is likely to occur if the election is proceeded with on that date, or that it is impossible to conduct the election as a result of natural disaster or other emergencies. “The commission will continue to monitor the situation in all the states and constituencies, consult with relevant stakeholders, and meet again in two weeks to review the situation and decide on a feasible date for the election.”
