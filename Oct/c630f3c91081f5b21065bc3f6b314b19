 FOLASHADE KEHINDE BRITISH Foreign Secretary, Dominic Raab, has called for an immediate investigation into the attack on #EndSARS protesters by soldiers at the Lekki tollgate on Tuesday night. Raab said in a tweet on Wednesday that the Nigerian government must urgently probe reports of brutality by its security forces and bring those accountable to book. He said this following a discussion on the development at the UK Parliament. “I am deeply concerned by the violence in Nigeria, including widespread reports of civilian deaths. We call for an end to all violence. The Nigerian government must urgently investigate reports of brutality by its security forces and hold those responsible to account,” Raab tweeted. The #EndSARS protests had turned bloody in Lagos as security operatives fired gunshots sporadically at #EndSARS protesters at the Lekki Tollgate on Tuesday night. Governor Babajide Sanwo-Olu had imposed a 24-hour curfew from 4pm on Tuesday in view of the violent turn the protests had taken in the state. The protesters at Lekki, however, defied the curfew and remained on the protest ground. Nigerians, at home and abroad, have continued to condemn the action of the Military with the Nigerian Bar Association also threatening a court action.
