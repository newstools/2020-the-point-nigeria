BY REBECCA AJANI THE Attorney General and Commissioner for Justice in Ekiti State, Olawale Fapohunda, disclosed, on Tuesday, that three female protesters were gang-raped at Fajuyi Park, in the state capital by hoodlums. Fapohunda, who spoke in Ado Ekiti while receiving the mothers of the victims, noted that it was regrettable that hoodlums had hijacked the protests, and warned protesters, especially the ladies, to be very careful and to note that hoodlums were in their midst. “It is regrettable that the legitimate protests against impunity by SARS has now been hijacked by undesirable elements who rape, assault and rob innocent citizens. It is becoming obvious that government cannot continue to allow the good people of Ekiti State to suffer in this manner,” he said. Fapohunda advised the mothers of the three victims to take them for medical check up at the Ekiti State Sexual Assault Referral Centre, the Moremi Clinic, Ekiti State Teaching Hospital. He also promised that the rapists would be apprehended. One of the mothers said they had appealed to their daughters not to join the protests but that they refused because they believed in the cause. “We are horrified that our daughters could be raped by those with whom they were fighting the same cause. We hereby plead with the Attorney-General to ensure that the rapists are apprehended and prosecuted,” she said.
