A police officer charged over the death of George Floyd has been released from prison after posting $1million bail. Derek Chauvin, a white Minneapolis police officer, stands accused of murdering Mr Floyd, an African American, on May 25. Chauvin was filmed kneeling on Mr Floyd’s neck for eight minutes and 46 seconds, despite him saying ‘I can’t breathe’. A bystander shouted “you’re killing him”, while a witness captured video of Mr Floyd begging to be freed as police pinned him to the street and witnesses screamed “get off him” before he lost consciousness. The 46-year-old officer was released from Oak Heights Prison in Minneapolis this morning, according to reports. Mr Floyd was pinned down by Minneapolis police officers arresting him on suspicion of using a fake $20 bill at a corner shop and being “under the influence” in the driver’s seat of a car. He was fired following Mr Floyd’s death and charged with second-degree murder, third-degree murder and manslaughter, although he denies all of the allegations against him. His death has sparked peaceful protests across the globe with people calling for an end to racism and police brutality. His sister, LaTonya Floyd, told the Daily Mirror she refused to allow her brother’s life to have been ‘taken in vain’. She urged Americans to vote ­“divisive” Donald Trump out of office, adding “If Trump is voted in for another four years, we are all going to hell.” Three other officers have been charged over Mr Floyd’s death. Thomas Lane, J Kueng and Tou Thao are charged with aiding and abetting second-degree murder and aiding and abetting manslaughter. A trial is set to take place in March 2021. – mirror.co.uk
