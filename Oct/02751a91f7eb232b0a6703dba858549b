ONDO State Governor and the candidate of the All Progressives Congress in the October 10, 2020 election, Rotimi Akeredolu, has said the forthcoming election will be a referendum on his performance in office in the last three and half years. Akeredolu who made this known while featuring on the Nigeria Television Authroty AM Show “Good morning Nigeria”, also allayed the fears of his supporters on the perceived influence of former Governor Olusegun Mimiko on the votes of the Zenith Labour Party candidate, saying Mimiko was nowhere in the scheme of things. “Which influence does he have? Mimiko doesnt have any influence in the Central District. Influence where he ran for Senate and lost. Mimiko is not even in the Central. He is not even anywhere in Ondo State.  Mimiko is not a force that anybody can talk about now,” Akeredolu claimed. He said, “The  key issue in the election for me appears like a referendum. The people will be determined to look at what we have done in the last three and half years.We were sworn- in on February 24, 2017. “It is going to be a referendum as to whether we have delivered on our promises. If we have done right in the face of the people, then they will make a choice. For me the choice is clear, it is something that an average Ondo citizen can see. Our little achievements are there for them to see.” He added, “If we are giving the opportunity of continuity, we are going to build on infrastructure that we have put in place. “When it comes to road construction, for instance, we have done pretty well. We have completed over 125 kilometres of roads and we have over 269 kilometres that we have not completed but we will complete.”
