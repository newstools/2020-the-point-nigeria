A traditional ruler in Osun State, Oba Adejoro Otebolaku, the Owalare of Ilare, has denied any involvement in a sex scandal reported in the media recently. Otebolaku, a prominent member of Ijesa North Traditional Council, while denying his alleged involvement in the sex scandal, said, “The matter is currently being investigated by the police.” Otebolaku declared that another monarch under his territory in Obokun Local Government Area of the state, Oba David Ogungbemi, the Aketewi of Iketewi, was the personality involved in the rape of the 14-year-old girl (name withheld), stressing that he wouldn’t go unpunished, if found culpable. The Owalare, in a statement he personally signed and made available to our correspondent in Osogbo, charged journalists to conduct proper investigations on the sex scandal. He assured the general public that “appropriate sanctions would be meted out to the monarch involved, if he is found culpable of the heinous act.” Owalare clarified that the media reports during the week that a traditional ruler in Ilare land was apprehended by the police for raping and impregnating a 14-year old girl in the town, was not him but Oba Ogungbemi. Recall that Oba Ogungbemi and his son, Idowu, were arrested by the Osun Police Command for allegedly raping a 14-year-old girl. It was gathered that the victim was living with one Esther Ogungbemi, who was her father’s sister in Ilare, Obokun Local Government Area of the state. The father and son were alleged to have defiled the girl and had intercourse with her by force. It was gathered that the girl became pregnant thereafter, thus propelling her father to report to the police Meanwhile, the State Police Command through its Public Relations Officer, Mrs. Yemisi Opalola, stated that the monarch and his son were still with the Crime Investigations unit of the State Command for investigation.
