It’s purely a personal issue – Press Secretary United States President Donald Trump has drawn criticism for refusing to follow his own health experts’ advice on wearing a mask in public. Although wearing a face covering is voluntary, it is recommended by many state authorities and federal doctors. Few of Trump’s staff are ever seen wearing masks. Trump’s latest public outing was to a ceremony early Friday, marking the 75th anniversary of the Allied victory over Nazi Germany in World War II. The President, who at 73 is well within the higher-risk group for COVID-19, met eight American veterans ranging in age from 96 to 100. Neither he nor the veterans wore masks, although he kept a few steps from them. “I was very far away from (the veterans),” Trump told journalists. “Plus the wind was blowing so hard in such a direction that if the plague ever reached them, I’d be very surprised.” According to White House Press Secretary, Kayleigh McEnany, the veterans “made the choice to come here because they’ve chosen to put their nation first. They wanted to be with their commander in chief on this momentous day. It was their choice to come here.” McEnany said mask-wearing is a purely personal issue. “This president is regularly tested. This president will make the decision as to wear a mask or not,” she said. Earlier this week, Trump made his first long-distance trip since the nation’s coronavirus lockdown began, visiting a Honeywell mask-making factory in Arizona. Again, he did not wear a mask in public, even while addressing a room full of factory employees, all wearing masks in accordance with company policy. – AFP
