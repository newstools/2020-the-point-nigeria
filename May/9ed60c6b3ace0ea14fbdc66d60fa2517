Operatives of the Osun Security Outfit, codenamed Amotekun Corps, on Saturday intercepted six men who traveled into state despite the ongoing lockdown. The travellers from Kebbi State were said to have defied the lockdown order and entered the state illegally. It was gathered that the intercepted travellers sneaked into the state through the jungle. According to an official of the Corps, the six Kebbi men entered the state through a forestÂ  at Ojo town in Egbedore Local Government Area of the state. The men were later led out of the state by the Amotekun team on patrol.
