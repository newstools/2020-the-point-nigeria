The police in Lagos have arrested a man, Abdulramon Amure, for allegedly raping his three-year-old daughter to death. Amure, alleged to be a serial rapist, had been on the wanted list of the police for allegedly defiling many minors in Lagos Island. Sources disclosed to our correspondent that the suspect raped his three-year-old daughter to death and also defiled so many children, but instead of being prosecuted by the police, he always got bailed out by some “powerful” men on Lagos Island. According to a group, “The mothers of the two of the children Abdulramon Amure abused opened up that the perpetrator has been arrested on several occasions for this same crime by the Adeniji Adele Family Support Unit, but before you say jack, his God fathers would have taken his bail. “It was further clarified that the three-year-old victim who died of complications as a result of the abuse, was actually his own biological daughter. “The baby was his first child. His wife could not withstand his presence and threats; she had to relocate to Ghana for her to be able to overcome the shock and pain. “It was alleged that one Otunba Kunle, a boss to Abdulramon Amure has been the ‘god father’ securing his release whenever he’s arrested. “Meanwhile, other survivors’ parents are rejoicing that finally the perpetrator is now in the police net, but doubt if he won’t be released as usual.” The Coordinator, Advocate for Children and Vulnerable Person Network, Comrade  Ebenezer Omejilile, said the suspect would face the full wrath of the law. “Quote me anywhere, the list is endless. This guy and his cohorts made sexual abuse case a social norm on the Island. They made the vulnerable persons more vulnerable because each time they are arrested their godfathers secure their bail. But this development of his arrest and prosecution would send a note of warning to his community of paedophiles,” he said. The Lagos Police Public Relations Officer, Bala Elkana, could not be reached as at press time.
