 Zamfara State Governor, Hon. Bello Mohammed Matawalle has approved the sum of N470 Million loan subsidy for food for the state’s civil servants. The governor disclosed this on Friday, when he hosted Labour leaders for the Ramadan breaking of fasting at his residence in Gusau, the state capital. Matawalle said his administration resolved to reduce the hardship being experienced in the state as a result of the Covid-19 pandemic and directed the supply of rice that will be sold to the state’s civil servants at a 50 percent discount. He also assured the labour leaders that there would be no cut in salaries as proposed by other governors, urging the state’s civil servants to appreciate government efforts at improving the welfare of the citizens. He promised them the continued payment of salaries and wages as at when due, including promotion and leave grants. Earlier in his address, the State NLC Chairman, Comrade Bashir Mohammed Mafara, thanked the governor for granting the subsidy approval to the state’s civil servants, saying it was the first time civil servants in the state were getting such a gesture. He promised that the union would continue to support and cooperate with the government in the implementation of all its policies and programmes.
