The Management of the Olusegun Obasanjo Presidential Library (OOPL), Abeokuta, Ogun State, has told workers to go home until further notice. In a letter signed by the Head, Human Resources, Administration and Procurement, Olanike Ogunleye, the management hinged its decision on the effect of the Coronavirus pandemic on business. The management also informed the workers that they would not be paid during the temporary cessation. The letter said, “As you are aware, the current COVID-19 pandemic has had a toll on all our business significantly. This has resulted in making some difficult business decisions. “Due to this situation, we regret to inform you that your employment will be put on hold till further notice. This temporary cessation is effective from 31st May, 2020, and until business picks up and you are recalled back to work, please note that you are not eligible for any payment during this period of cessation.” “We didn’t make single kobo since March. We didn’t sack anybody. It was clearly stated there, temporary cessation. We have not made a kobo since March 16 or thereabout. No bailout and we didn’t get palliative from the government. How do we pay salaries? It’s normal we have to allow people to go temporarily,” the Managing Director of the library, Vitalise Ortese, said.
