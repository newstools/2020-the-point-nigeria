 Prof. Ibrahim Agboola Gambari, who was reported to have been appointed as the next Chief of Staff to President Muhammadu Buhari, arrived the Presidential Villa, Abuja, at about 11am this morning (Wednesday). He was received by the State House Permanent Secretary, Tijani Umar, and some other senior officials of the Presidency. No official statement has, as at the time of filing this report, backed his widely reported appointment, as senior aides to the President neither confirmed nor denied the report. Gambari was screened in line with precautions against COVID-19, before gaining access into the main building. He was sighted using a hand sanitiser and having his temperature checked by Villa staff. Nigerians are, however, curious that Gambariâ€™s appointment has been clouded with uncertainties since the news broke. Until confirmed categorically by the Special Adviser on Media and Publicity to the President, Femi Adesina, his appointment remains a rumour, analysts say.
