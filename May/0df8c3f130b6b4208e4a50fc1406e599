A 28-year-old identified as Ogbonna Daniel from Asaga in Arochukwu, Abia State, has allegedly beaten his next door neighbour’s  female house help, aged 11 to death. The suspect residing at Omege area of Abakaliki, Ebonyi State capital, with the deceased and her guardian, was said to have had a misunderstanding with the maid  on Saturday, May 2 over the pouring of dirty water by Ukamaka (the deceased) in the wrong place in the house. But when Daniel beat her over the act, the  maid was alleged to have fainted and died before she could be taken to the Alex Ekwueme Federal University Teaching Hospital Abakaliki for treatment. Some neighbours, who pleaded not to be identified for security reasons, alleged that the suspect, who seemed to have some unresolved grievances with the family the maid was serving before the incident, also  beat up Ukamaka’s pregnant mistress, which resulted in bodily harm and an eye injury. They also alleged that the suspect  had been terrorising / intimidating people in the area, especially in his house over trivial matters such as sharing/payment of electricity bills. As at the time of filing this report, the late maid’s remains had been AEFUTHA mortuary and the suspect arrested by policemen from the Kpirikpiri Division. Investigation was also said to be on going after which the suspect would be charged to court for prosecution.
