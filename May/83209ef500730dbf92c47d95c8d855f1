 A total of 3, 751 inmates, including convicts and awaiting trial persons have, so far, been released in line with a presidential directive on the decongestion of custodial centres, the Nigerian Correctional Service has said. The NCoS, in a statement released by its Public Relations Officer, DCC Austin Njoku, said the process, which became necessary in the wake of the Covid-19 pandemic, was ongoing, adding that final figures would be made public at the end of the exercise. Recall that President Muhammadu Buhari had ordered the decongestion of custodial centres in Nigeria as part of efforts to contain the spread of Covid-19. The Minister of Interior, Ogbeni Rauf Aregbesola, later announced, during the flag-off of the Presidential Amnesty at the Medium Security Custodial Centre in Kuje, Abuja, that a total of 2, 600 inmates would benefit from the process across the 36 states and the Federal Capital Territory. The NCoS said, “The NCoS wishes to state that the process is ongoing, as other measures are in place to ensure continuity and the final figures will be made public at the end of the exercise. “A breakdown of the release shows that 2, 740 convicts and 1, 011 Awaiting Trial Inmates have so far benefited from the exercise. “The Controller General of Corrections, Ja’afaru Ahmed, wishes to use this medium to express his profound gratitude to all the State Governors, Chief Judges and other stakeholders in the Criminal Justice System who have worked tirelessly to carry out this exercise and encourage its continuity. “The Service is assuring that all inmates qualified for the amnesty and jail delivery will be released accordingly.”
