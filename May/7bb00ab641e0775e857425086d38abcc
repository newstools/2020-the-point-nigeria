President Muhammadu Buhari has commended the President of the African Development Bank, Nigeria’s Dr Akinwumi Adesina, over the clean bill of health given him by the Board of Directors of the financial institution. A statement on Thursday by the Special Adviser, Media and Publicity to the President, Femi Adesina, said a report, dated May 5, 2020, signed by Niale Kaba, Chairman of the Bureau of the Board of Governors, indicated that Adesina had been exonerated of allegations against him by whistleblowers, which were thoroughly investigated by the Ethics Committee of the Board of Directors. A recommendation was also made to Governors of the African Development Bank, and African Development Fund. Kaba was quoted as saying, “On the basis of the results contained in the report of the committee, I am of the view that we should adopt its conclusions by declaring that the President is totally exonerated of all the allegations made against him.” “President Buhari says Dr Adesina has served the African continent well, and has made his motherland proud. He wishes him greater successes in the position of responsibility he occupies,” Adesina said.
