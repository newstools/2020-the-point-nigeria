Wife of the Osun State Governor, Mrs. Kafayat Oyetola, has charged government at all levels to formulate viable social policies for the elderly in the society as a means of cushioning the hardships confronting them during the coronavirus pandemic. Mrs. Oyetola, who is the President, Ilerioluwa Development Initiative, gave the charge in Igbajo and Oke- Bode communities in Boluwaduro and Atakumosa West Local Government Areas of the state during the house-to-house distribution of food items to the elderly and other vulnerable people in the two communities. Wife of the governor, who was in company with the NGO team members and wives of top political office holders in the state, said if the elderly were properly taken care of, they would continue to contribute their quota towards moulding future leaders. She stated that the door-to-door distribution of items was to ensure maintenance of social distancing to avoid community transmission of the deadly virus. The governor’s wife also sensitised the people of Igbajo and Oke- Bode communities on the need to wear facemasks and wash their hands regularly in order to prevent the spread of the dreaded disease. Receiving the relief items, beneficiaries from Igbajo and Oke- Bode communities appreciated the palliatives and prayed for the first lady. Speaking during the food items’ distribution, the Owa of Igbajo, Oba Adeniyi Olufemi Fashade, commended the wife of the Governor and her NGO for the door-to-door distribution of food items to the elderly and other vulnerable people in the communities. According to the traditional ruler, the kind gesture will ameliorate the sufferings of the aged. Oba Fashade asked the Federal, state and local governments to replicate such a gesture.
