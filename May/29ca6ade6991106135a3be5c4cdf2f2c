The Supreme Court has nullified the judgment which convicted a former Governor of Abia State, Orji Kalu. The apex court also set aside the judgment, which convicted Ude Udeogu, a former Director of Finance and Account at the Abia State Government House. Justice Mohammed Idris of the Federal High Court in Lagos had sentenced Kalu to 12 years imprisonment, and Udeogu, to 10 years imprisonment on April 24, 2019. Both defendants had filed an appeal to challenge the judgement at the apex court. The apex court, in a unanimous verdict on the appeal delivered by Justice Ejembi Eko, declared that the conviction of the appellants was null and void. Justice Eko hinged the declaration on the ground that Justice Mohammed Idris was already a Justice of the Court of Appeal, as of the time he delivered the judgment. He held that a Justice of the Court of Appeal could not operate as a judge of the Federal High Court. The Supreme Court, therefore, ordered the Chief Judge of the Federal High Court to reassign the case for trial.
