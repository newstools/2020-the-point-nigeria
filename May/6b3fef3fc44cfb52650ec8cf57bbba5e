This Workers’ Day is unlike most in our recent past. Our health workers are on the frontline, working tirelessly to save lives while risking theirs – and for this, humanity is appreciative and thankful. At the same time, we have millions of other unskilled workers whose livelihoods have been disrupted and have fallen on hard times as a result of the same pandemic. As we commemorate this day, my mind reaches out to you all, and I wish to say to you that, tough times will not last forever, and things will soon be back to normal. The immediate next phase in our national struggle demands a higher level of individual responsibility from us all. In doing so, we must continuously adhere to social distancing protocols, maintain the highest hygiene standards, and be mindful that although we may not see the virus and might not be showing symptoms, the world has not been given the all-clear. Our actions will go a long way in helping humanity to win this war. And as humans – the highest in the combined ecosystem occupying the earth, we will win this.
Happy Workers’ Day.
