… ‘No grain of truth in the allegation’  The Presidency, on Tuesday, dismissed reports that President Muhammadu Buhari had cancelled scores of appointments signed off by the late Chief of Staff, Abba Kyari, as fake. Senior Special Assistant to the President on Media and Publicity, Garba Shehu, who dismissed the allegation, advised Nigerians to ignore the insinuations behind them. According to him, the President was duly re-elected and will not transfer the power given to him to anyone else. He said, “The attention of the Presidency has been drawn to media reports alleging that President Muhammadu Buhari has cancelled a number of memos and appointments signed off by his former Chief of Staff. Not surprisingly, these reports have quoted unnamed sources. “There is not a grain of truth in these reports and Nigerians should please ignore the insinuations behind them. “President Buhari was duly re-elected by Nigerians in February 2019. He has not and will never cede to anyone else, that power and trust given to him by the Nigerian people.”
