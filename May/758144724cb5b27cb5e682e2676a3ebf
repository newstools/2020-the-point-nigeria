 The Founder of Daar Communications Plc, Chief Raymond Dokpesi, has recovered from COVID-19 and has been discharged from the isolation centre at the University of Abuja. Two of his grandchildren have also been discharged after they all tested negative for Coronavirus twice. His son and the other members of the family who had tested positive are, however, reportedly still receiving treatment. In a statement he released after he tested negative, a copy of which was made available to The Point, Dokpesi thanked Nigerians for their goodwill messages while appreciating the Minister of Health, Dr. Osagie Ehanire, the Secretary to the Government of the Federation, Boss Mustapha, and the health workers in general for their support. He said, “I am exceptionally indebted to God Almighty for keeping and protecting me and my entire family all through our isolation at the University of Abuja Teaching Hospital, Gwagwalada Isolation Centre. “We are better acquainted with the personal sacrifices many Nigerians are making to ensure that we collectively defeat this pandemic. This cuts across the policymakers, the care providers, and even the cleaners whose job puts them at constant risk of exposure.” The media mogul added that with well thought out policies, and highly coordinated investment in the health system, Nigeria’s fight against COVID-19 might become the catalyst for the much needed reform in the health sector.
