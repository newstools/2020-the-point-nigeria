 The Federal Government has said it is considering opening schools with morning and afternoon classes. Minister of State for Education, Emeka Nwajiuba, disclosed this at the daily press briefing of the Presidential Task Force on COVID-19 in Abuja. According to him, the government cannot afford to risk the safety of students across the country. He said, “We may have classes in the morning and classes in the afternoon so that we will have the whole of the infrastructure divided provided they can serve us. “I am not sure we will have classes at night. But we can do with morning and afternoon for now.” The minister, however, maintained that the decision was based on advice from experts as well as those of the World Health Organisation. Recall that the minister had last week announced that schools would be reopened any moment soon, despite the COVID19 pandemic.
