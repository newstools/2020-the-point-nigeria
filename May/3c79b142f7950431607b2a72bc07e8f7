Governor Udom Emmanuel of Akwa Ibom State has announced the immediate shut down of all livestock markets in the state. The governor also said that no new consignment of livestock would be allowed in the state until further notice, while advising livestock sellers to sell off their stock. He disclosed this in a statement, on Tuesday, by the Secretary to the State Government and Chairman COVID-19 Management Committee, Emmanuel Ekuwem, on Tuesday, warning that defaulters would be prosecuted. The Akwa Ibom government, however, did not give reasons for the closure. The statement said, “I have been directed by the Governor, Mr Udom Emmanuel, to announce the immediate shutdown of all livestock market in the state for the rest of May 2020. “By this announcement, no new consignment of livestock – goats, cows, and rams, will be allowed into the state until further notice.
