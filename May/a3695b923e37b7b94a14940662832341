 The Chief of Army Staff, Lt. Gen. Tukur Buratai, has said that over 1,000 Boko Haram/ISWAP terrorists were killed in the last six weeks. The COAS made this known during a luncheon organised for the troops of “Operations Lafiya Dole” in Maiduguri on Sunday. Nigeria has recorded tremendous gains in the war against insurgency since Buratai relocated to the Theatre of Operations. Scores of the terrorists have been killed and several others injured, with factional leader Abubakar Shekau reportedly on the brink of surrender. In his address, the COAS assured that the troops were closer to victory, especially with the insurgents suffering numerous casualties. He added that a total of 84 high ranking members of Boko Haram logistics and informants have been arrested within the same time frame. “We have put concerted efforts against BHTs and ISWAP,” he said, adding, “We have severely dealt with the BH terrorists and ISWAP. “We have successful displaced major camps of the BHTs. We have killed 1015 terrorists and ISWAP in the ongoing operations in Borno, Yobe and Adamawa state, respectively. “We have also arrested 84 BHTs logistics and information suppliers in the ongoing operations, which started 12 April, 2020.” He commended the efforts of the Nigerian Air Force, Navy, Police, Department of State Services, Civilian Joint Task Force and hunters for the resounding successes against the terrorists. Earlier in the day, the Military had said it killed a total of 35 Boko Haram Terrorists (BHT) and ISWAP criminals during several attacks in Borno State between May 11 and 22 this year.
