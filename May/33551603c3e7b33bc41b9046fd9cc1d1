 Governor Seyi Makinde of Oyo State has reacted to the death of his Commissioner for Environment and Natural Resources, Kehinde Ayoola, who passed on in the early hours of Thursday. The Governor described the late Ayoola as a loyal friend, who he had known and worked with for 18 years, saying that he would be sorely missed for his oratory skills and his love for the people of Oyo Town and Oyo State in general. The late commissioner, who represented Oyo East/Oyo West State Constituency between 1999 and 2003 on the platform of the Alliance for Democracy (AD), served as the Director-General of the Seyi Makinde Campaign Organisation, under the platform of the Social Democratic Party in 2015. In 2019, he was the Deputy Director-General of the Omituntun Campaign Organisation, which ushered in the Seyi Makinde administration in Oyo State. Ayoola was Speaker, Oyo State House of Assembly under the administration of the late Lam Adesina. The Governor said, “I received with deep sadness, the news of the death of my dear friend and colleague, Rt. Honourable Kehinde Ayoola. Up until his death this morning, he served as the Honourable Commissioner for Environment and Natural Resources in Oyo State. “I met the late Rt. Honourable Ayoola in 2002, when we worked together as members of the Fortune Group for the election of Senator Rasheed Ladoja. He also served as the Director-General for my 2015 campaign and the Deputy Director-General for my 2019 campaign.” He added, “He was a loyal friend with a dedication to duty that cannot be questioned. He will be sorely missed for his great oratory skills and his love for the people of Oyo Town and Oyo State. May his soul rest in peace. “Rt. Hon. Ayoola will be remembered for his altruistic service to Oyo State since his emergence on the political turf in 1999.”
