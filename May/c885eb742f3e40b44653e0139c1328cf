The Minister of State for Labour and Employment, Festus Keyamo, SAN, has advised against the re-introduction of total lockdown in parts of the country, saying it will be counterproductive. He said this on the heels of concerns that the refusal of majority of Nigerians to abide by safety rules against the spread of COVID-19 in the hot areas could create an unmanageable situation that could result in a higher death toll. “My personal view is that another total lockdown would be counterproductive. Before defeating the virus, we must learn to live with it all around us and practise the skills of avoiding it like a landmine. Practice makes perfect. We cannot perfect those skills by locking ourselves up,” Keyamo tweeted. Governor Babajide Sanwo-Olu of Lagos State had said, on Saturday, that his government was not satisfied with the level of compliance with the rules guiding the relaxed lockdown in Lagos. He warned that if there was no improvement in the next couple of days, “we would be forced to evoke the very painful decision of bringing the entire system under a lockdown again.”
