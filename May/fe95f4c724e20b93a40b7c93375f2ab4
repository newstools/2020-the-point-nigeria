President Muhammadu Buhari has ordered the importation of the herbal remedy developed by Madagascar to cure its COVID-19 patients to Nigeria. Secretary to the Government of the Federation, Boss Mustapha, disclosed this on Monday during the briefing of the Presidential Task Force on COVID-19. According to Mustapha, “Madagascar has made allocations to various countries, and sent them to Guinea Bissau. We‘re supposed to make arrangements to freight Nigeria’s allocation from Guinea Bissau; it‘ll be subjected to the standard validation process for pharmaceuticals. “Mr. President has given instructions for the airlifting of Nigeria’s allocation of the Madagascar COVID-19 Syrup; also given clear instructions that it must be subjected to the standard validation process for pharmaceuticals; there will be no exceptions for this.” The SGF assured Nigerians that the task force was not relenting in its efforts to stop the spread of COVID-19 in the country. “Nigeria has only one National Response to the COVID-19 pandemic. Where there are differing Strategies is in the implementation of non-pharmaceutical interventions. But as far as the (Health) Response is concerned, there is only one National Response,” Mustapha said. African countries, including Equatorial Guinea, Guinea-Bissau, Niger, and Tanzania have taken delivery of consignments of the potion launched last month. Madagascar said the drink is derived from artemisia – a plant with proven anti-malarial properties – and other indigenous herbs.
