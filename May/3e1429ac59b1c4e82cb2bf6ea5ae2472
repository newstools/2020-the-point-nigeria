 …promises to remit more The Joint Admissions and Matriculation Board has made an interim remittance of N3.5billion to the Federation account, from the excess generated from its operations during the conduct of the 2020 Unified Tertiary Matriculation Examinations. The Head, Media and Information, JAMB, Dr. Fabian Benjamin, who dislcosed this in a statement on Sunday, said the Board had earlier returned N3.5billion, following the sale of ePINs to UTME candidate, bringing the total remittance to N7billion for now. The board, however, promised to make further remittances once operations are concluded and proper audit done. Benjamin said, “It (the board) had earlier made the payment of over N3.5bn to candidates by way of reduction of N1,500 from the cost of each ePIN sold to each candidates as graciously directed by Mr. President totaling over N3.5bn, bringing the total remittances this year to over N7b with the assurance to remit more as soon as its operations are concluded and proper audit of its books done. “From the outset, it had been the intention of the present leadership of the Board to return to federal coffers, whatever is left unutilised from its operational imperatives. The immediate benefit of the move manifested in the reduction by President Muhammadu Buhari of the UTME Registration fee payable by candidates from N5000 to N3500, which entails the transfer of over N3b to candidates and guardians annually via the reduction in the cost of application documents.” He added, “Before the reduction in the cost of application EPINs, the Board had remitted over N7b in 2017 and replicated same in subsequent years until the gracious action by the Buhari administration’s unprecedented decision to give back to candidates a percentage of the cost of registration. “To sustain the gesture, the Board will continue to come up with innovations on ways to ensure that candidates are provided with world-class services at modest cost as obtained anywhere in the world.”
