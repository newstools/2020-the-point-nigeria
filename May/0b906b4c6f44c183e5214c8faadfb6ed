…says I want to cast out evil spirit from him  The police in Osun have arrested a woman simply identified as Iya Ayo, for allegedly tying her son inside a sack for days. It was gathered that the woman, during her interrogation by the police, said she was trying to deliver the 10-year-old boy from the evil spirit that possessed him. It was not certain, however, if the evil spirits had left the boy following the deliverance. The woman, who resides in Owode, Osun  State, was exposed when a neighbour heard the boy’s cry for help. The neighbour immediately alerted the leaders of the community, who in turn alerted the police and the woman was arrested, and her son freed. When interrogated, Iya Ayo, who is said to have been separated from Ayo’s father, said her son was possessed with an evil spirit and was in the habit of stealing people’s money. She said she then decided to deliver him from the evil spirit of stealing by forcing him inside the bag and locking him inside a wardrobe. The spokesperson of the State Police Command, DSP Yemisi Opalola, confirmed the incident and said the woman had been arrested and made to sign an undertaking never to maltreat the child again. Opalola said efforts were being made to search for the father of the child so that the woman could hand Ayo over to him. She added that the police are closely monitoring the situation. ”We went to arrest her and she told her part of the story; how the boy had been disturbing her. In a nutshell, the police told her to go and look for the father of the boy if she cannot take care of the child again and she promised to do so. The DPO also followed up yesterday to ensure that the father is found. There is no way the police can keep the child with them. They have made her to write an undertaking even with a surety, who promised she would never do it again,” she said.
