 Access Bank Plc has debunked reports that it has concluded plans to sack 75 per cent of its staff and also close over 300 branches. Describing the news as malicious, the bank said it was a distraction from its genuine and compassionate plan to protect its workforce. This was disclosed, on Monday, in a statement signed by the Company Secretary, Sunday Ekwochi, published on the website of the Nigerian Stock Exchange. The bank said to close branches, it would require the approval of the Central Bank of Nigeria, adding that it had neither applied for nor obtained such approval. According to the financial institution, at the outset of the COVID-19 pandemic lockdown, in-branch operations were suspended at different locations as directed by the CBN and in line with business continuity plans at vulnerable spots; whilst it continued to provide services through alternative digital platforms. It said, “In line with the phased re-opening of the economy effective May 4, following the Presidential directives, we will be resuming in-branch services in some of our affected branches in a programmed manner to ensure the health and safety of our employees and customers. “This is also necessary to provide relevant contingency should there be any incident arising from the pandemic. We deny in its entirety the baseless and twisted speculation that the bank is sacking 75 per cent of its workforce.” Access Bank said it had commenced engagement with various stakeholders with a view to ensuring that it provides the relevant services and optimum manpower as might be required on an ongoing basis. “As we navigate the new normal occasioned by the COVID-19 pandemic, we wish to assure all our esteemed stakeholders that in our traditional manner, the bank will continue to ensure that its actions and decisions are guided by fairness, justice, equity and good conscience,” it said.
