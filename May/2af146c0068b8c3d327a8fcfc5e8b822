A former Senior Special Assistant to ex-President Olusegun Obasanjo on Public Affairs, Dr. Doyin Okupe, says he and his wife, Aduralere, have tested negative for COVID-19 after receiving treatment for two weeks in an isolation ward in Sagamu, Ogun State. Okupe, who said that he and his wife had just been discharged in a Facebook post on Tuesday, stated that on April 23 they had both tested positive for Coronavirus and were moved the same day to the isolation centre for treatment. According to him, “On April 23, my wife Aduralere and I tested positive for the Covid-19 virus. That same day we were moved to the isolation ward facilities in Sagamu. Glory be to God Almighty Jehovah and His Son Jesus Christ through whose blood that was shed for us at Calvary and by whose stripes we became healed and tested negative twice for the Covid-19 Virus. We were discharged from the isolation centre, in the early hours of today.” He expressed gratitude to Governor Dapo Abiodun, who he said sent him prayers very regularly while he and his wife were undergoing treatment at the isolation centre. Okupe added, “I thank the Honourable Commissioner for Health, Dr. Tomi Coker, who was a flower girl at my wedding in 1977. I also thank the health workers under the leadership of Dr Olaitan and Dr Ayeni. “It is incredible what dangerous and sometimes sacrifices they paid, including very long hours of work stretching for a week at a time, all to ensure that we, the patients under their care live. My wife and I are grateful to you all.”
