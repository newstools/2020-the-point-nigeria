A new case of COVID-19 infection has been recorded in Osun State. The state’s Commissioner for Health, Dr. Rafiu Isamotu, said in a statement on Saturday that the case was a Kano returnee, who sneaked into Osun. Isamotu said that the new case sneaked into Iwo from Kano State before his neighbours alerted the Osun COVID-19 team. With this development, Isamotu said the number of active cases in the state had risen to three. The commissioner further disclosed that a total of 434 tests had been conducted at the NCDC accredited Testing Centre in Ede, adding that testing was still ongoing in the state. He said, “The COVID-19 confirmation test for one suspected case came back positive on Friday out of the 14 samples we sent for testing at the NCDC accredited Testing Centre; the African Centre of Excellence for Genomics of Infectious Diseases, Ede, during the week. The case sneaked into the state from Kano State and the neighbours immediately alerted our COVID-19 team. “Presently, we have three active cases in the state. The good news is that the new case on arrival self- isolated, although he wasn’t showing any symptom of the virus.” Isamotu, who said that the state government was not resting on its oars in preventing community transmission of the virus, appealed to residents of the state to always be on the alert and immediately report any suspected case of Coronavirus. He also urged them not to accommodate anyone from outside the state, saying that it’s dangerous to do so at the moment. “I am appealing to all the residents of the state to always be on the alert, take charge and report any suspected case by calling our COVID-19 hotlines. Let us desist from accommodating people in our homes, no matter who they are, and stop inviting your family and friends to return to the state at this time as this might be dangerous,” Isamotu said.
