Former Governor of Ogun State, Senator Ibikunle Amosun, has commiserated with the Orunsolu family, the League of Imams and Alfas, and the entire Muslim faithful in Ogun State, over the death of the Chief Imam of Egbaland, Alhaji Liadi Orunsolu, on Tuesday, 26 May, 2020, at the age of 98 years. Amosun, who is the Senator representing Ogun Central in the Ninth National Assembly, described the death of Alhaji Orunsolu as painful, noting that Egbaland, in particular, and Ogun State in general, had lost a respected religious leader and a renowned Islamic scholar. In a statement he personally signed, Amosun said, “The Chief Imam was an erudite Islamic scholar who was well versed in Islamic Religious Knowledge. He was a symbol of unity who rallied the Ummah in Egbaland as one indivisible entity during his lifetime. “Alhaji Orunsolu maintained effective leadership as the Chief Imam of Egbaland and President of League of Imams and Alfas in Ogun State, and also provided wise counsel to the entire Rabittah in the entire Yorubaland, Edo and Delta States.” He prayed that “Almighty Allah (SWT) grants Imam Liadi Aljannah Firdaus, whilst giving his family and the entire Muslim Ummah, the fortitude to bear the irreparable loss.”
