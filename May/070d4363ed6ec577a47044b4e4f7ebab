 No fewer than 17 bandits have been killed in their hideouts around Mashigi Galbi, Damba Community and Kabarasha villages in Gwagwada District of Kaduna State. Coordinator of Nigeria’s Defence Media Operations, Major General John Enenche, said in a statement on Monday that troops of Operations Thunder Strike and Whirl Punch in conjunction with the Air Component of Operation Gama Aiki, killed the 17 bandits in the villages located in Chikun Local Government Area of the state. Enenche said some other bandits escaped during the operations with serious gunshot wounds. He also disclosed that during the operation, three empty houses and a church building were partially damaged at Kabarasha village, adding that no civilian casualty was recorded. The military spokesman noted that the Nigerian Armed Forces had already set up a panel to investigate the occurrence in liaison with the Kaduna State Government. Enenche said the damaged buildings had been identified and adequate compensation would be paid to their owners. He said calm had been restored to the area while residents, who initially fled the area because of fear of reprisal from the bandits, had all returned to the community. Enenche said, “The High Command of the Armed Forces of Nigeria hereby reassure the general public that it will continue to work assiduously to restore peace and security in the North West. “It equally thanks the general public for their support and cooperation, while encouraging them to continue to provide credible information that will facilitate the operations of the Armed Forces of Nigeria.” Some bandits reportedly killed a security guard and kidnapped three others, including the Sarki of Doka, a banker and his daughter, in a recent attack at Danhono II and Dokan Mai-Jama’a communities within the Millennium city area of Chikun Local Government Area of the state.
