 The Senate has begun investigations into the current status of the much debated 5th Generation (5G) network in Nigeria. The decision of the upper legislative chamber to probe the network status came on the heels of a motion by Senator Uche Ekwunife of the Peoples Democratic Party (Anambra Central). The Senate mandated its Committees on Communications, Health, Science and Technology, ICT and Cyber crimes, to do a thorough investigation into both the status of the 5G network and its overall impact on Nigerians. They are to report back in four weeks. Details laterâ€¦
