A pan-Nigeria group, Association of Progressive Nigerians has appealed to the Central Bank to withdraw old and tattered naira notes from circulation due to the raging COVID-19 pandemic in the country. The group made the appeal in a statement in Lagos jointly signed by its President, Alhaji Mohammed Bello and General Secretary, Oluwole Aina. The group said the appeal became imperative necessary because the continued circulation of old, tattered naira notes, which had passed several hands, might lead to further spread of the deadly Coronavirus. The statement reads, “We hereby appeal to the CBN Governor, Mr. Godwin Emefiele, to please withdraw these old and tattered naira notes from circulation as continued recycling of such notes may endanger public health and lead to the further spread of the dreaded Corona Virus. “We observe with sadness that what most banks are doing is to push out these dirty naira notes in endless recycling of what should have been withdrawn and replaced with freshly minted notes. “It is more worrisome that when you withdraw from ATMs across the country, what you have on your hands are dirty, mutilated and tattered naira notes which ought to be rejected outright by all Nigerians lest they expose themselves to a health hazard.” The group also noted that, in advanced countries, once such dirty notes are received by banks, they are immediately sent to the mint for replacement. “We appeal to the CBN governor to ensure that the best international practices are observed in the handling of old naira notes. “Our naira notes should be seen as a national symbol and we should not diminish our country in the comity of nations,” it said.
