 BY ANDREW EKEJIUBA Former Barcelona winger Emmanuel Amuneke has refused to compare Victor Osimhen to any footballer but is backing the Napoli striker to emulate the achievements of three former Chelsea players Didier Drogba, George Weah and Samuel Eto’o. The Super Eagles star joined Napoli this past summer for a fee of 70 million euros, plus 10 million euros in variables, after a fantastic season with Lille, scoring 18 goals in all competitions. Osimhen became the most expensive player signed by Napoli following his move, surpassing Hirving Lozano who was acquired from PSV Eindhoven for 42 million euros. Asked by reporters who Osimhen can be compared to, Amuneke said: “Osimhen is Osimhen. Each player has his own qualities. Weah, Drogba or Eto’o have done great things, the hope is that Victor can do them too”. Amuneke believes his former pupil can flourish as the main striker in a 4-2-3-1 formation, a role he has adapted to admirably in the last one year with the national team. “No, he doesn’t know how to play only the central striker, and 4-2-3-1 is not a new formation for him, he often plays in the national team. “Tactically he has grown, I said, but he can still grow, especially in Italy where it is a very important aspect. “I played against Baggio who had immense talent and thanks to Serie A he became the champion he was. Here, I hope that Victor can take such a step and become a champion too,” added Amuneke.
