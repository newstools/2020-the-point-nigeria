 BY FOLASHADE KEHINDE THE Lagos State Police Command, on Sunday, carried out raids simultaneously on identified black spots, reasonably believed to be harbouring criminals and hoodlums, across the 14 Area Commands of the state. In the swift operations, which began at about 7am, police operatives of the Command arrested 720 suspects with incriminating items, the Command disclosed. The items, according to a statement signed by the Public Relations Officer of the Command, SP Olumuyiwa Adejobi,
include locally-made guns and life cartridges, charms, weed suspected to be Indian hemp, substances suspected to be cocaine “and some items suspected to have been looted from various shopping outlets within the state during the recent #EndSARS violence.” The statement said the Commissioner of Police in the state, Hakeem Odumosu, had earlier warned and directed police officers and men to move against lawlessness and criminality in Lagos, adding that he affirmed the zeal of the Command to sustain the operations, even beyond the yuletide season. It said the Commissioner had also directed the Deputy Commissioner in charge of SCID, Panti, to commence discreet investigation on the arrested suspects. “CP Hakeem Odumosu has however directed the Deputy Commissioner of Police in charge of SCID, Panti, to commence discreet investigation on the arrested suspects for immediate prosecution. He also urged those whose items were looted during the recent Endsars violence to come up for claims of their items with prove of ownership,” the PPRO said. The CP also commended the officers and men of the Command for the successful operations, while he charged them to be at alert for more operations across the state.
