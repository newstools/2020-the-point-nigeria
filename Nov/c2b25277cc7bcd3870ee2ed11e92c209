 REBECCA AJANI THE Ondo State High Court, sitting in Akure, the state capital, has sentenced three persons to death by hanging over the abduction of three reverend sisters in 2016. The reverend sisters had been kidnapped at the Onipetesi area of the Odigbo Local Government Area of Ondo State. They were reportedly held hostage for 11 days after which a sum of N1million was said to have been paid to secure their release. Those who were arrested in connection with the abduction included Reuben Akinbehinje, Saheed Oyewo, Seun Lajuwomi, Abimbola Akinbehinje, John Uche, Seun Akintan and Lateef Hammed. Reuben and Abimbola are married. The suspects had been arraigned on an eight-count charge bordering on conspiracy, kidnapping, armed robbery, aiding and abetting kidnapping, and accessory. Following a series of court proceedings after the initial arraignment, and submissions by the defence and prosecuting counsels, Justice Ademola Adegoroye ruled that the prosecution proved the case of conspiracy, armed robbery and kidnapping beyond reasonable doubt against three of the defendants. They are Reuben Akinbehinje, Seun Lajuwomi and John Uche. One of the defendants, Saheed Oyewo, had died during the trial, it was learnt. The three defendants found guilty were however sentenced to death by hanging, while Justice Adegoroye said the prosecuting counsel could not produce any evidence against Seun Akintan and Lateef Hameed, and thereby discharged and acquitted them. Abimbola Akinbehinje was, however, only charged with being an accessory in the matter, and fined N50,000.
