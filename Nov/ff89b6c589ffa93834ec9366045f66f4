 FOLASHADE KEHINDE THE National Universities Commission has transferred ownership of the Ladoke Akintola University of Technology, Ogbomoso, to the Oyo State Government. The Commission, however, revealed that the Osun state Government would also take over the College of Health Sciences in Osogbo. The resolution puts to rest the lingering crisis over the ownership of LAUTECH. The Executive Secretary of the National Universities Commission, Prof. Abubakar Rasheed, who disclosed this at a media briefing in Abuja, noted that both Governor Seyi Makinde of Oyo State and Adegboyega Oyetola of Osun State signed a Memorandum of Understanding to that effect. He also expressed optimism that the new arrangement would restore peace to LAUTECH. “It is gratifying to note that after extensive deliberations, negotiations and consultations, both owner states mutually agreed terms and the joint ownership of LAUTECH was formally dissolved,” Rasheed said. “The mutually agreed dissolution was formalised through the signing of a memorandum of agreement by the Executive Governors of Oyo and Osun States witnessed by the Attorneys-General of both States, giving legal effect to the transfer of ownership of LAUTECH to the Government of Oyo State and the College of Health Sciences, Osogbo to the Government of Osun State,” the NUC boss added. LAUTECH was established in 1990 by the old Oyo State Government with the main campus located in Ogbomosho, while the teaching hospital was established in Osogbo.
