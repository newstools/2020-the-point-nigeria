 BY AGNES NWORIE, ABAKALIKI AHEAD of the planned official defection of Governor David Umahi of Ebonyi State to the All Progressives Congress, major stakeholders of the ruling party, and APC Governors across the country, have arrived the state. The Governors and other top players of the party are expected to fly into Enugu before traveling to Abakaliki to welcome Umahi officially into their fold. The Point gathered that elaborate activities, including strategy meetings, had been lined up as part of efforts to ensure that Umahi’s defection actualised the plan for APC to expand its political stronghold in the South East region. The Deputy Governor of Ebonyi State, Eric Kelechi Igwe; and the Speaker of the Ebonyi State House of Assembly, Francis Ogbonna Nwifuru, on Wednesday, received three out of five APC Governors at Akanu Ibiam International Airport, for Thursday’s event. They are Governors Mai Mala Buni of Yobe State (National Caretaker Chairman of APC); Abubakar Atiku Bagudu of Kebbi State; and Mohammed Badaru Abubakar of Jigawa State. The Minister of Justice and Attorney General of the Federation, Abubakar Malami, is also in the team of well wishers. Umahi had, on Tuesday, announced why he defected from the PDP to the ruling All Progressives Congress, saying the PDP had been unfair to the South East since 1998.
