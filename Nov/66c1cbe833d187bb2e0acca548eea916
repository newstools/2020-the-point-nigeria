 FOLASHADE KEHINDE A native of Kwara State, in Nigeria, Oye Owolewa, has become the first Nigerian-American to be elected to the United States Congress. The 30-year-old, whose father is from Kwara and his mother from Oyo, will represent the District of Columbia (DC) as a shadow congressman in the US Senate under the Democratic Party. Owolewa polled a whopping 164,026 votes, representing 82.84 per cent of the total votes cast. Voters in DC elect two shadow senators, who are not officially sworn or seated by the US Senate. These non-voting delegates cannot vote at plenary but can vote in committees, speak on the floor of the chamber, and sponsor legislation. “Looks like WE DID IT!!! I want to thank everyone, from family and close friends to DC residents,” Omolewa said on Instagram. He added, “Because of your contributions and sacrifices, I stand before you as America’s first Nigerian-American congressman. “In this role, I’m going to fight for DC statehood and bring our values to the lawmaking process. “While today is a day for some celebration, the hard work also follows. Again, thanks so much for everything. I wouldn’t be here without you all.”
