They went away with him along with his wife and daughter. “The University Security Division quickly informed the operatives of the Police Intelligence Response Team that advanced to the scene following the distress call. “There was an exchange of fire between the kidnappers and the mobile police operatives. When it was clear that they would be overpowered, the kidnappers ran into the bush along with the victims. “As the police went after them up to Kasuwar Da’a village, bordering the University, the kidnappers then released the wife and the daughter and went away with the husband. Some empty shells were recovered from the scene.” He said the Inspector General of Police and other security agencies, as well as all relevant government establishments, had been duly informed of the unfortunate incident. “The Vice-Chancellor, Professor Kabir Bala, urges the University community to remain calm and vigilant to avoid the recurrence of the incident,” the statement said.
