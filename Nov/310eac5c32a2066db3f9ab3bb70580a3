 FOLASHADE KEHINDE THE Managing Director, Lekki Concession Company, Abayomi Omomuwa, has disclosed that the network of the surveillance camera at the Lekki Tollgate stopped recording around the time of the Military attack on #EndSARS protesters because it was tampered with. He said the camera stopped recording at about 8 pm. LCC is the operator of the Lekki Tollgate. “I can confirm that inside here is the video footage that our surveillance camera was able to record for the 20th of October,” Omomuwa said. Nigerians have continued to ask for the exact circumstances surrounding the shooting and alleged killing of peaceful protesters in Lagos. The Point had reported that the 81 Division of the Nigerian Army had broken its silence on the alleged shooting, saying that the Lagos State Government had requested for the military to intervene, when the situation was fast degenerating into anarchy, in order to restore normalcy. But it denied the allegation that soldiers opened fire on #EndSARS protesters, saying, “At no time did soldiers of the Nigerian Army open fire on any civilian. From the onset of the ENDSARS protest, there was no time personnel of 81 Division Nigerian Army Lagos were involved.” The Army disclosed these in a statement by the Acting Director, Army Public Relations, Major Osoba Olaniyi. It said, “The attention of Headquarters 81 Division Nigerian Army has been drawn to a viral video on social media in which it was alleged that civilian protesters were massacred by soldiers at Lekki Toll Plaza. This allegation is untrue, unfounded and aimed at causing anarchy in the country. “However, the decision to call in the military was taken by the Lagos State Government (LASG) after a 24-hour curfew was imposed. “This was as a result of the violence which led to several police stations being burnt, policemen killed, suspects in police custody released and weapons carted away.”
