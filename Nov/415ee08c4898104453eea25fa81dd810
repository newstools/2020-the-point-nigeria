* IBRAHIM ABDULLAHI MILITARY operatives in Loko, Adamawa State, on Friday, killed three suspects allegedly linked to the murder of the Chairman of the All Progressives Congress in the state, Philip Shekwo. Nine other suspects were also arrested in connection with the murder. These were disclosed by Governor Abdullahi Sule when he received the Trade Union Congress Women Commission at the Government House, in Lafia, the state capital, on Saturday. The Point had reported that the state Commissioner of Police, Bola Longe, who confirmed the killing of the APC chieftain, last Sunday, said he was found dead with gunshot wounds, adding that findings pointed more at assassination than abduction. He had said, “We found his body near his house. Normally when kidnapping is carried out, it is for profit making. But this has shown that within a twinkle of an eye, the man was killed, no demand was made whatsoever. “I believe it was assassination but that notwithstanding, we are going to carry out exhaustive investigation that will give us a clue to what has actually happened.” While speaking on Saturday, Governor Sule disclosed, “Three suspects, linked to the murder of the state APC Chairman were killed on Friday by military operatives in Loko, while nine other suspects also linked to the murder of the late Chief Shekwo were arrested. “The military is not taking it lightly with these criminals. We are facing a few security challenges in the state but the security agencies have not rested.” He pledged the commitment of his administration to using resources judiciously in ensuring the security of lives and property in the state.
