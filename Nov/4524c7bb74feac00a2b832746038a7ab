 FOLASHADE KEHINDE THE Director-General of the World Health Organisation, Tedros Ghebreyesus, is in self isolation, following his contact with a COVID-19 patient. He said in a series of tweets via his verified handle @ Dr.Tedros that he would self quarantine over the following days. The WHO DG, however, said he was well without symptoms. “I’ve been identified as a contact person of someone who has COVID-19 symptoms, I am well and without symptoms but will self quarantine over the coming days and self quarantine from home,” he tweeted. “My colleagues and I at WHO will continue to engage with partners in solidarity to save lives and protect the vulnerable,” he added. The DG has been very active since the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic, reviewing strategies, periodically, along with other officials, to contain the spread of the virus across the globe.
