 BY ANDREW EKEJIUBA English Premier League side Arsenal have reopened contract talks with American-born striker of Nigerian descent Folarin Balogun. Balogun remaining at the Emirates Stadium beyond the end of the 2020-2021 season is back on the agenda with first team manager Mikel Arteta keen for the England U20 international to extend his contract which expires in the next seven months. The Hale End Academy product was earlier frozen out of the club’s first team reckoning after breakdown in contract talks but things have changed in recent weeks with the 19-year-old coming off the bench to make his professional debut in last month’s Europa League fixture against Dundalk. In addition, he has been handed the captain’s armband in Arsenal’s last five games in the Premier League 2. There was talk of a possible departure for Balogun in the summer transfer window but the Gunners turned down an offer from Sheffield United just as they did to Brentford in the winter transfer market. He has registered 15 goals from 40 appearances for Arsenal U23s since he debuted for the age group in the 2017-2018 season.
