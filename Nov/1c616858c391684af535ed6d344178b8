* BY SALIU SALIU THE Kano State Hisbah Board has written a letter to a radio station in the state, Cool FM, warning it against using the term “Black Friday” for its sales promotion. Black Friday is an informal name for the Friday following Thanksgiving Day in the United States, and it is celebrated on the fourth Thursday of November. Top stores all over the world usually announce best price deals, which they call Black Friday deals. The Principal Executive Officer II, Kano Hisbah Board, Abubakar Ali, in a letter addressed to the radio station, and signed on behalf of the Commander-General, said the majority of those living in Kano were Muslims that “consider Friday a holy day.” He also notified the station that the Hisbah Corp would be on ground on that day to avoid the occurence of immoral activities and maintain law and order.  He said, “I am directed to write and notify you that the office is in receipt of a complaint for the conduct of ‘Black Friday Sales’ on November 27, 2020. “Accordingly, we wish to express our concern on the tagging of Friday as ‘Black Friday’ and further inform you that the majority of the inhabitants of Kano State are Muslims that consider Friday as a holy day. “In view of the foregoing, you are requested to stop calling the day ‘Black Friday’ with immediate effect and note that the Hisbah Corps will be around for surveillance purposes with a view to avoiding occurrence of any immoral activities as well as maintaining peace, harmony and stability in the state.”
