 LINUS CHIBUIKE THE Federal High Court in Abuja has ordered the arrest of a former Chairman of the defunct Pension Reform Task Team, Abdulrasheed Maina. This order followed the repeated failure of the embattled Chairman to appear in court for the continuation of his trial, bordering on money laundering. Justice Okon Abang revoked the bail the court earlier granted the defendant, and also gave the approval for the trial of Maina in absentia. Maina is facing a 12-count criminal charge preferred against him by the Economic and Financial Crimes Commission. He is being charged along with a firm â€“ Common Input Properties and Investment Limited. The court also indicated that the lawmaker representing Borno South Senatorial District in the National Assembly, Senator Ali Ndume, who stood surety for Maina, could forfeit the N500m bail bond he provided. It fixed November 23 for Ndume to show cause why he should not forfeit the N500million bail bond. This came on the heels of an application made by the EFCC, pursuant to sections 184 and 335(4) of the Administration of Criminal Justice Act, ACJA, 2015. The court concluded however that the absence of the former chairman from his trial, four consecutive times, was without a cogent or verifiable evidence.
