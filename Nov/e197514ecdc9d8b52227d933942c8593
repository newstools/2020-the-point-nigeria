 BY ANDREW EKEJIUBA SUPER Eagles manager, Gernot Rohr, is still awaiting his most influential player in the 2021 Africa Cup of Nations qualifiers, Victor Osimhen. The Napoli striker is Nigeriaâ€™s most important player in the Africa Cup of Nations qualifiers in terms of goal contribution, having been involved in a remarkable 83.3 per cent of the goals (3 goals, 2 assists) scored by the national team. President Amaju Pinnick revealed on Tuesday that the Nigeria Football Federation (NFF) sent Osimhen another flight ticket after his earlier flight ticket was cancelled. Rohr can count on Villarreal winger Samuel Chukwueze, CSKA Moscow star Chidera Ejuke and late invitee Paul Onuachu with the trio reporting for international duty in Benin City on Wednesday. Semi Ajayi, Abdullahi Shehu and Jamilu Collins have yet to show up in Benin City and the same applies to goalkeeper Daniel Akpeyi. The Kaizer Chiefs glovesman is currently airborne after leaving South Africa and has given his word that he will join his international teammates soon. Meanwhile, Chukwueze arrived Super Eagles Etherno Hotel camp in Benin alongside Paul Onuachu and Chidera Ejuke as the numbers of players rose to 19. List of Super Eagles players in camp are: Ahmed Musa William-Troost Ekong Alex Iwobi Ola Aina Joe Aribo Leon Balogun Kevin Akpoguma Sebastin Osigwe Zaidu Sanusi Tyronne Ebuehi Etebo Oghenekaro Maduka Okoye Ikechukwu Ezenwa Chidozie Awaziem Kelechi Iheanacho Emmanuel Dennis Chidera Ejuke Samuel Chukwueze Paul Onuachu
