 BY AGNES NWORIE, ABAKALIKI THE Peoples Democratic Party, Ebonyi State Chapter, on Friday, suspended a former Governor of the state, Sam Egwu, and all the state’s PDP National Assembly members, among others, over “anti-party activities.” The decision to suspend the affected PDP members, 24 in all, was reportedly reached at the State Working Committee meeting on November 13, 2020. A statement signed by the Chairman of PDP in the state, Onyekachi Nwebonyi; and Secretary, Simon Anyigor, noted that the suspended members were expected to appear before the Party’s Disciplinary Committee to defend themselves. The statement said, “In the resolution of the SWC of 13th November, 2020, they were suspended from the party for anti-party activity. “They were accused of planning to destabilise the party by constituting a parallel list of executives, evidence of which have been obtained. “They are therefore required to appear before the Party’s Disciplinary Committee to defend themselves in the allegation on Friday, 20th November, 2020. Failure to comply with this directive attracts outright explusion from the party. “Please, accord the necessary action.” Those suspended include: Senator Michael Ama Nnachi, Senator Obinna Ogba, Hon. Chukwuma Nwazunku, Hon. Sylvester Ogbaga, Hon. Livinus Makwe, Hon. Chris Usulor, and Hon. Victor Aleke among others.
