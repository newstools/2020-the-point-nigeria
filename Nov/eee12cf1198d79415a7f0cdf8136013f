 BY FOLASHADE KEHINDE THE Akinsemoyin Ruling House of Lagos has described the invasion of the palace of the Oba of Lagos by hoodlums, who also stole the Oba’s staff of authority (Opa Ase), as sacrilegious and an abomination in the land. It has therefore called on custodians of the heritages, Yoruba kings, traditional heads, and all religious leaders “to work together to redeem and cleanse Lagos land of the taboo. The ruling house made the call in a statement titled, “#EndSARS protest: Akinsemonyin ruling house condemns attacks on Oba’s palace”, jointly signed by the Olori Ebi Akinsemoyin Ruling House of Lagos, Chief Musliu Anibaba; Prince Saminu Akinsemoyin; Prince lbrahim Adekunle; and the Chairman of Egbe Omo Eko Nimi Lagos Forum, Prince Ademola Akinsemoyin. The palace was invaded and vandalised a day after the Military attacked #EndSARS protesters at the Lekki Tollgate, Lagos, following the protesters’ alleged disobedience of curfew orders by the Lagos State Government. The Akinsemoyin ruling house said it watched with shock the rioters’ forceful entering, ransacking, looting and desecration of lga ldunganran, the Palace of Oba of Lagos. It added that the invasion showed lack of respect for Lagos traditional heritages. The statement said, “Painfully, the desecration of Oba’s Palace, in particular, the stolen ‘Opa Ase’ and our ancestral items with impunity has not only exasperated the tense atmosphere but also shows lack of respect for Lagos traditional heritages. “Pertinently, the sad events were sacrilegious and an abomination to Lagos land, heritage and prohibited by Yoruba and Lagos tradition and social customs. “Consequently, we implore the custodians of our heritages, Yoruba kings, traditional heads, and all religious leaders to work together to redeem and cleanse Lagos land of the present taboo and obscenity; and more importantly, strengthen our heritages that have been tampered with and forestall future occurrence and assault on royalties.”
