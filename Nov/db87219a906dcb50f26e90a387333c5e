 LINUS CHIBUIKE THE Minister of Finance, Budget and National Planning, Zainab Ahmed, disclosed on Tuesday that the total public debt stock of Nigeria would hit about N38.68trn by December 2021. She added that, based on existing approval, the public debt stock would stand at an estimated N32.51 trillion by December 31, 2020. Ahmed spoke during her presentation to the Senate Committee on Local and Foreign Debts. She said, “The total public debt stock, comprising external and homes debts of the Federal and State Governments and the Federal Capital Territory stood at N31.01trn ($85.90 billion) as at June 30, 2020. “This is projected, based on existing approval, to rise to N32.51 trillion by December 31, 2020 and N38.68 trillion by December 31, 2021.” She also disclosed that Sukuk fund was currently N162bn for 45 roads across the six geopolitical zones. According to the Minister, she would prefer a situation where one major road in a geopolitical zone is selected and finished to pave the way for efficiency. “We were not able to do that because of the processes in which appropriation is made both at the executive as well as the legislative arms of government. But truly, if we are able to just take one or two projects at a time and complete it before going to the next one, it will be better,” she advised. The minister added, “What the contractor does is the bit that has been cut out for him to do in that particular area. Once the fund is released and it is finished, we would stop again. That is the consequence of these numerous projects that we put in the budget. “It is not related to Sukuk-funded projects alone, it cuts across all the projects. You will see a road that costs, may be, N5bn, and you will see a provision for N100m, N200m or 300m.” Going that route, she said, the project would never finish. “After two years, the contractor comes back and asks for variation, and the amount keeps growing. I wish that we get to a point when we will sit down as government and agree that, let us select a few projects, finish them in 2020, and then in 2021, we select the next, so that on a geopolitical basis, those selections are done as a collective process,” the minister stated.
