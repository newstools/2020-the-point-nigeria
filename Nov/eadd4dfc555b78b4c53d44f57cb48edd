 BY BANYO TEMITAYO PRESIDENT Muhammadu Buhari will, on Tuesday December 1, 2020, roll out the much awaited National Gas Expansion Programme (NGEP) in Abuja. The event will herald the formal dispensing of autogas (CNG & LPG) products at two Nigerian National Petroleum Corporation Retail stations. A statement by Garba Deen Muhammad, Group General Manager and Special Adviser Media to the Minister of State on Sunday, said, “The roll out is the culmination of the resolve of the President Buhari-led Government to deepen domestic usage of natural gas in its various forms as well as making it the first choice source of cheaper and cleaner energy for Nigerians in their personal and industrial endeavours.” According to him, the HMSP will also use the opportunity to, on behalf of the Federal Government, hand over CNG-powered mass transport buses to the Nigeria Labour Congress. This, he said, was part of the agreement reached with the Organised Labour during negotiations and in recognition of the role organised Labour plays in the quest to bring relief to ordinary Nigerians, a view which president Muhammadu Buhari shares. “The Federal Government Autogas program will deliver at least one million vehicle conversions by the end of 2021 and herald the clean energy transition for Nigeria and delivery of cheap transportation fuel,” the statement said.
