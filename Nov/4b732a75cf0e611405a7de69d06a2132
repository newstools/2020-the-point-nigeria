 BY VICTORIA ONU, ABUJA THE Transmission Company of Nigeria, on Tuesday, unveiled plans to tackle the overloaded Sokoto-Birnin Kebbi 132kV Single Circuit Transmission Line to increase bulk power transmission to distribution centers in Sokoto State and environs. In a statement signed by its General Manager, Public Affairs, Ndidi Mbah, on Tuesday, TCN explained that the new line when completed, would enable the Kaduna Electricity Distribution Company to deliver more electricity to its customers in Sokoto axis. This, it said, was aimed at solving the prevalent poor power supply situation in the area. The statement said, “Over the years, the Sokoto–Birnin Kebbi 132kV transmission line had become overloaded due to massive increase in human population and attendant socio-economic development in the area. “The reconductoring work would rectify the current low voltage and consequent poor power situation so that electricity consumers can enjoy more stable and quality power supply.” The reconductoring work, according to the statement, will commence on the 130 Kilometers Sokoto-Birnin Kebbi Single Circuit Transmission line this week and will be completed by the third week of December, this year. TCN stressed, “To ameliorate the effect of scheduled outages on electricity customers during the period, TCN will work from 8am to 5pm daily, during which time there would be no supply of electricity to the affected areas. “Electricity supply would however be restored daily, from 6pm to 8am. We apologise for every inconvenience and solicit the support and understanding of the state governor and good people of Sokoto State as well as the Kaduna Electricity Distribution Company, to enable us successfully execute this project, which will greatly improve power supply in Sokoto State and environs.”
