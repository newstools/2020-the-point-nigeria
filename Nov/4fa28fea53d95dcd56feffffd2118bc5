… ‘Security agents shot dead my fiancée’ Nigerian security forces are carrying out extrajudicial killings in Oyigbo, say residents of the town in southern Rivers state. They accuse the army of carrying out revenge killings after authorities said three policemen and six soldiers were killed by members of a proscribed separatist group. Amnesty International also said it had received reports that “soldiers are allegedly invading homes” and that “some residents reported seeing dead bodies on the street, allegedly shot by soldiers”. Monday Bakor, 29, told BBC Igbo that police officers shot dead his fiancée Queen Nwazuo on 23 October while they were both locking up their barbing salon. “I saw the policeman wearing [a] red beret. Before I could know, I heard a very loud sound, not in the air, directly at the shop. The bullet pierced through the iron door and hit her,” he said. “I rushed her to a hospital where she was confirmed dead,” he added. Police spokesman Nnamdi Omoni told the BBC that no report had been made of the incident. Mr Bakor said he could not do this because of a 24-hour curfew in the area and pointed out the closest police stations had been burnt down. – BBC
