 ABISOYE JOHNSON AN Ogun State High Court, sitting in Abeokuta, has sentenced one Musiliu Owolabi, to death by hanging for killing his lover, Afusat Idowu. Owolabi, 39 years, was convicted on a one-count charge of murder for an offence he was said to have committed on February 1, 2018, at the Camp area of Abeokuta. The Chief Judge of Ogun State, Justice Mosunmola Dipeolu, noted that the prosecution had proved its case beyond reasonable doubts and concluded that Owolabi was guilty of the offence as charged. He was thereafter convicted and sentenced to death by hanging, having been found to have contravened the provisions of Section 319 of the Criminal Code, Laws of Ogun State 2006. State prosecution counsel, James Mafe, explained that the convict, a motor mechanic, had taken his lover to a hotel for pleasure. After awhile, he said she complained of stomach ache and later started foaming from her mouth. “The convict took her to his vehicle, on his way, he noticed she was dead, and secretly took the deceased to an uncompleted building, dug a shallow grave and buried her without disclosing to anybody,” Mafe said. He stated, “The convict was arrested when the younger brother of the deceased went to the police station to complain that his sister who told him she was going for a naming ceremony at Bode Olude area never returned. “Upon police investigation, with the help of tracking the deceased phone, it was discovered that the convict was the last person that spoke with the deceased. On his arrest, he made a confessional statement to the police and took them to where he buried his lover.”
