 LINUS CHIBUIKE THE President of the African Development Bank, Akinwumi Adesina, has dismissed a tweet by a British lawmaker, accusing former Nigerian Head of State, Yakubu Gowon, of stealing “half of Nigeria’s Central Bank.” Adesina described Gowon as a man of great honour, decency and integrity, and indicated that the lawmaker should be careful of disinformation in a tweet on Thursday. The British lawmaker, Tom Tugendhat, had, during a parliamentary debate on a petition asking the Government of the United Kingdom to impose sanctions on Nigerian officials involved in alleged brutality during the #EndSARS protests, made the allegation of corruption against the former Head of State. But describing the comment as rubbish, Gowon had, in an interview with BBC, responded, “I don’t know where he got that rubbish from. I served Nigeria diligently and my records are there for all to see.” “Be careful of misinformation! H.E. General Yakubu Gowon, Nigeria’s former Head of State, is a man of great honour, decency, honesty, amazing simplicity, humility and integrity. I know him. A great and admirable elder statesman of Nigeria. His honesty and integrity are impeccable,” the AfDB boss tweeted.
