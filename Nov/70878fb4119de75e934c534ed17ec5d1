 ADELEKE ADESANYA A 51-year-old man, Ajayi Peter, who was found guilty of a rape offence, has been named in ‘shame publication’ by the Ekiti State Judiciary. The name and shame publication is in line with the state’s zero tolerance for sexual violence, according to the state Judiciary. Peter who is said to be a native of Itapa Ekiti in the Oye Council Area and a resident of Ijero Ekiti in the Ijero Local Government Area of the state, was sentenced to life imprisonment by the High Court of Ado Ekiti for raping a 12-year-old girl. Ekiti State Attorney General, Olawale Fapohunda, in a statement, said the name and shame publication was in furtherance of the state government’s zero-tolerance for sexual violence in the state. Fapohunda also said that pictures of convicted sex offenders would now be pasted in their last known addresses, as well as the most prominent place in the offender’s community. “Under the initiative, names and photographs of convicted rapists are pasted on billboards in prominent public spaces in their communities and their council headquarters and as well uploaded on the website of the ministry of justice and other state government platforms, in addition to being recorded in the sex offenders’ register,” he said. “The offender will also be disqualified from benefitting from the governor’s power of prerogative of mercy,” he noted.
