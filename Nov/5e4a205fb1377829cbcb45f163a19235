 BY LINUS CHIBUIKE PRESIDENT Muhammadu Buhari, on Wednesday, commended Governor David Umahi of Ebonyi State for his defection from the Peoples Democratic Party to the ruling All Progressives Congress, saying the move was “driven by principle rather than opportunistic motives.” The President said he was proud of the Governor for taking the bold step in line with his conscience. He said people might call Umahi names but noted that men of principle would usually pay such price for acting in line with their conscience and conviction. The President’s message on the defection of Umahi was contained in a statement by his Senior Special Assistant on Media and Publicity, Garba Shehu. Shehu said, “President Muhammadu Buhari has commended the defection of Ebonyi State Governor, David Umahi, to the All Progressives Congress (APC), describing it ‘as a bold move driven purely by principle rather than opportunistic motives.’ He quoted the President as saying, “I am proud of Governor David Umahi for taking this bold decision in accordance with his conscience and principles rather than any external influence or coercion. “Good governance is very important to us in the APC, and I’m glad that the governor has cited this as a major factor in his decision to join us. I urge our citizens to pay less emphasis on identity politics if we want our democracy to make a positive impact on our country. “With men like Umahi, I foresee a brighter future for our democracy because the voters will be more motivated by performance records of parties and their candidates. “Let me once again commend the boldness of Governor Umahi for taking this courageous decision in a country where principles are in short supply among many. “I know people might call him names, but that is the price men of principle have to pay for acting according to their conscience and convictions.”
