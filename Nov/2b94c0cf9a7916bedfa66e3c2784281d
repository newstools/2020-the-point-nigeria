 BY LINUS CHIBUIKE PRESIDENT Muhammadu Buhari, on Friday, met with some chieftains of the All Progressives Congress from the South West. The APC leaders, led by Chief Bisi Akande, however, refused to disclose the details of the meeting to State House Correspondents. The closed-door meeting held at the Presidentâ€™s office, Presidential Villa, Abuja. Former Governor of Ogun State, Chief Olusegun Osoba, Dr. Abayomi Finnih and Prince Tajudeen Olusi, were in attendance. Findings however revealed that the meeting might not be unconnected with positioning the South West ahead of the 2023 general elections, especially at a time the party is about undertaking its members revalidation and registration exercise.
