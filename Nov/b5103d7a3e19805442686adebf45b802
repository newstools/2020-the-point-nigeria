 Mario Balotelli has been in talks with Barnsley about making a free agent move. The Italian has been a free agent since his contract with Brescia was terminated at the end of last season. And The Sun says Balotelliâ€™s agent has had contact with Barnsley co-chairmen Chien Lee and Paul Conway. Balotelli was flicked off by Brescia after failing to turn up to training. The 30-year-old has a bad-boy reputation after spells with Inter Milan, AC Milan, Manchester City, Liverpool, Nice, Marseille and Brescia.
