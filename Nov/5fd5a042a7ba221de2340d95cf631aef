 BY FOLASHADE KEHINDE THE Lagos State Task Force on the Environment and Special Offences (Enforcement) Unit has announced the commencement of public auction of 44 vehicles seized from traffic offenders. A public notice posted on Twitter by the Chief Press Secretary to the Governor of Lagos State, Gboyega Akosile, said all necessary arrangements for the auction of the said vehicles had been concluded with a court order. The CPS listed 44 vehicles and their registration numbers, and drew the attention of the owners to the auction. The notice titled, ‘List Of Court-Forfeited (One-Way) Vehicles To Be Auctioned’, said, “Lagos State Environmental and Special Offences (Enforcement) Unit (Task Force) wishes to inform interested members of the public, especially owners whose vehicles have been forfeited to the Lagos State Government that all necessary arrangement has been concluded with a ‘Court Order’ in accordance with the law for a ‘Public Auction’ of the vehicles which would hold at the Agency’s car park behind Shoprite, Alausa, Ikeja, on Monday 23rd of November 2020. “It is pertinent to state that the vehicles were forfeited by the Lagos State Special Offences (Mobile Court) for driving against traffic (One-Way), thereby contravening the Lagos State Transport Sector Reform Law 2018.” The Point had reported that the Lagos State Government said last Wednesday that in spite of the criminal activities of motorcyclists, who had taken laws into their hands and attacked its Task Force team, 131 motorcycles had been seized; 15 riders arrested and prosecuted; and 150 vehicles impounded in various areas of the state. The Government said this was done in line with its resolve to enhance the enforcement of the Lagos Traffic Law 2018 with which it had been checking the excesses of “commercial motorcyclists and others who drive against oncoming traffic and ply restricted routes.” These were contained in a statement by the Commissioner for Information and Strategy in the state, Gbenga Omotoso. Omotoso also revealed that a total of 97 vehicle owners had been prosecuted for various traffic offences, while 28 tricycle owners were arraigned in court, amid the enforcement, which began last Tuesday.
