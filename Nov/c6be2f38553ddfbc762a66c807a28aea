BY FOLASHADE KEHINDE A trader, on Tuesday, said he broke his spine in 2018, when police operatives threw him off a three-storey shopping complex at Alaba Market, Lagos. The trader, Ndukwe Ekekwe, 34, was narrating his ordeal in the hands of men of the defunct Special Anti-Robbery Squad to the Lagos State Judicial Panel of Inquiry and Restitution for victims of SARS brutality. According to him, he was unlawfully arrested on February 16 and taken to the SARS head office at Ikeja, where he said he was stripped naked and brutalised. He said the operatives never told him why he was arrested. He also told the panel that the policemen followed him back to his shops the following day, forced the doors of the three shops open and looted his phone accessories. It was when he raised the alarm that the operatives threw him off the three-storey building, he said. Ndukwe, who was aided to the panel sitting by his aged mother, owing to a spinal cord injury, said his father was also bedridden with stroke.
