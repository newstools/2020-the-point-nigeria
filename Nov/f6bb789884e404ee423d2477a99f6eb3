 AYO ESAN THE Uyo Zonal Office of the Economic and Financial Crimes Commission has arrested one Umoh Archibong, a contractor notorious for allegedly using fake contract documents to obtain about N1.8bn (One billion, Eight hundred million naira) from unsuspecting members of the public. He was arrested on Friday November 6, 2020, at a hotel in Uyo, Akwa Ibom State. His modus operandi is brandishing fake contract documents to prospective victims, and enticing them with promises of huge returns if they agree to fund the execution of the contracts. Archibong met his Waterloo when one Okika Ugochukwu petitioned the Commission on July 30, 2019, alleging that sometime in June 2019, Achibong approached him with the information that he had been awarded two contracts by Hensek Construction Company and VKS Construction Company, both in Uyo, for the supply of laterite and borrow pit sand, and convinced him to invest N39million ( in tranches between June 15 to June 25, 2019) with a promise of paying him N18,000 monthly until he receives payment for the contracts. The petitioner further alleged that, after he received payment from him and others, Archibong severed communication with them; that all efforts to get back the invested capital and accrued interest, totaling N45, 000, 000.00, proved abortive. The two companies which Archibong claimed awarded him the contracts, Hensek Construction Company and VKS Construction Company, denied having any dealings with the suspect. Since his arrest, a total of 38 victims have come forward with claims that they were also defrauded by the suspect under the same guise. Under interrogation, the suspect claimed he invested the proceeds of crime in ponzi schemes and acquired several exotic cars. The suspect will be charged to court as soon as investigation is concluded.
