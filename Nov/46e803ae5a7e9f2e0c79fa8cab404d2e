 BY LINUS CHIBUIKE THE lawmaker representing Adamawa North Senatorial District, Senator Elisha Abbo, has said the Peoples Democratic Party should deal with the defection of Governor David Umahi of Ebonyi State to the All Progressives Congress before making a pronouncement on his own action. Abbo, who was reacting to a statement by the National Publicity Secretary of PDP, Kola Ologbondiyan, which said the party was in the process of replacing him in the National Assembly, said he dumped his former party (PDP) to be able to contest for the governorship of his state under APC. According to him, there is crisis in the PDP in Adamawa State, caused by the activities of Governor Ahmadu Fintiri. Abbo’s defection letter was read during plenary on Wednesday by Senate President Ahmad Lawan. He had hinged his action on an alleged mismanagement of the PDP in his state and the need to join hands with President Muhammadu Buhari in continuation of what he described as great achievements. But Ologbondiyan had warned that the lawmaker was fully aware of the constitutional implication of his defection. Abbo however responded, “Did they ask Umahi to resign? Go and ask them. Governor Umahi just defected from PDP to APC as a sitting governor of Ebonyi State. Did they ask him to resign? There is a crisis in the (PDP) party in my state. That is the truth. I believe internal democracy in the party has suffered in the last one year when the governor assumed office. “As you all know, it is only in Adamawa State that we have reformed PDP.  There is a crisis in the party in Adamawa State and the Governor is the cause of the crisis.”
