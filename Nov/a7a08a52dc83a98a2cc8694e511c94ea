 DEMOCRATIC nominee, Joe Biden, pulled ahead of President Donald Trump early Friday in the race for Georgia’s 16 electoral votes. The latest figures in Georgia, as of 4:45 a.m. ET, showed Biden leading with 2,449,371 votes, or 49.39% of the ballots cast, and Trump with 2,448,454 votes, or 49.37% of ballots cast. Libertarian candidate Jo Jorgensen was a distant third in the Peach State, with 61,380 votes, or 1.24%. The numbers represented 99 percent of the total votes cast in Georgia. The shift in leadership in the Southern state was a good sign for Biden in his bid to reach the 270 electoral votes needed to secure the presidency and deny President Trump a second term. The Fox News Decision Desk had Biden needing just six more electoral votes to reach the magic number of 270, and winning Georgia – if Biden maintains his newfound lead – would put the former vice president 10 points over the mark. Meanwhile, other battleground fights remained in Pennsylvania, North Carolina and Nevada – with President Trump still very much in the overall race if he can manage to win those fights and make a comeback in Georgia. – Fox News
