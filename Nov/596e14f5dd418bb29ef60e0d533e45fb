 BY ANDREW EKEJIUBA Victor Osimhen’s agent William D’Avila expects quick return to action for the injured Nigeria international and possibly see him involved in some capacity when Napoli take on AS Roma in the Serie A on November 29. Osimhen missed Napoli’s home loss to AC Milan last weekend due to an injury he picked up during the crazy 4-4 draw with Sierra Leone few days ago and is not in the reckoning to face Rijeka in the Europa League on Thursday despite serving out a one-game ban. D’Avila expects his client to return to full training in the coming days before the visit of an in-form Roma side who have not lost since the opening day at Hellas Verona. Speaking to reporters, D’Avila said: “The boy is very well, we hope to see him back on the pitch as soon as possible: in a few days we will see him train again with rest of the team. “His adaptation phase is over, sorry for the injury that stopped him in a delicate period of the season”. In eight appearances across all competitions for Napoli so far this season, the most expensive African-born player in history has scored two goals.
