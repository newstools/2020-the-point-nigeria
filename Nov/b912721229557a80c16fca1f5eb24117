 FOLASHADE KEHINDE THE Army has said it was initially not happy with Governor Babajide Sanwo-Olu for denying that he invited soldiers to the Lekki tollgate to restore order. Commander, 81 Military Intelligence Brigade, Victoria Island, Lagos, Brig. Gen. Ahmed Taiwo, said this when he briefed the Lagos State Judicial Panel of Inquiry on Saturday. He disclosed this just as he agreed that the governor had reasonable grounds to invite soldiers when violence broke out on October 2020. “I spoke with the governor and said the Army was unhappy that he said he did not ask the Army to intervene. But I’m sure, after we’ve watched everything, we saw he had more than reasonable grounds to ask the Army to intervene,” Taiwo said. The Lagos Governor had, in an Arise TV interview, in the heat of the crisis sparked by the shootings at Lekki tollgate, said the state government did not invite the soldiers. “The Army does not report to me. I have reported the matter to the highest command in the military. It’s not something we are going to gloss over. A judicial panel will be set up to investigate it. I have escalated it to the highest level of the military,” he had said. The panel had earlier adjourned the sitting on November 7, following the disruption of proceedings by the youth panel members protesting against the freezing of the bank accounts of #EndSARS promoters by the CBN.
