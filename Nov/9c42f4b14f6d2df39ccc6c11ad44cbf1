 BY TIMOTHY AGBOR, OSOGBO THE Police in Osun State have arrested five pupils for allegedly stabbing a colleague during school hours. According to the police, the accused students committed the offence on November 23, 2020, around 1pm at Ifeoluwa Grammar School, Osogbo. The police said the five students were with the intent to kill one Yekeen Basiru before they allegedly stabbed him on his back and left hand with an axe. The five pupils, identified as: Abdulateef Surajudeen (18years), Musibau Quadri (20yrs), Tunde Sikiru (20yrs), Azeez Ibrahim (18yrs) and Jelili Adegoke (16yrs), were on Wednesday arraigned before an Osogbo Magistrate’s Court on five counts of conspiracy, attempted murder, unlawful society and malicious damage. The police prosecutor, Inspector Jacob Akintunde, informed the court that “the five pupils and others, now at large, on November 23, 2020, around 1pm at Ifeoluwa Grammar School, Osogbo with the intent to kill, stabbed one Yekeen Basiru on his back and left hand with an axe.” “They engaged in an unlawful society known as Eiye Confraternity Society, damaged the building of Ifeoluwa Grammar School and windscreen of Mercedez Benz ML320 with registration number AP 665 SGB, property of Ajibade Kehinde,” he said. He added that the offences committed were contrary to Section 320, 516, 64 and 451 of the Criminal Code Cap 34. Vol II, Laws of Osun State 2002. However, the five pupils pleaded not guilty to the charge preferred against them. Counsel for the defendants, led by Toba Ayodele, made an oral bail application for the pupils, stating that bail was their right under the law. Meanwhile, the prosecutor opposed the bail, noting that the pupils might run away and that the wounded person was still in the hospital. The presiding magistrate, A. A Adeyeba, granted the bail to the five pupils with the sum of N1 million and two sureties each. He adjourned the case to January 27, 2021, for mention.
