 BY LINUS CHIBUIKE A Federal High Court in Abuja on Monday ordered that the lawmaker representing Borno South Senatorial District in the National Assembly, Senator Ali Ndume, be remanded in Kuje Correctional Center. Justice Okon Abang gave the order, following Ndume’s inability to produce a former Chairman of the defunct Pension Reformed Task Team, Abdulrasheed Maina, who is standing trial for alleged money laundering to the tune of N2bn. Abang said Ndume, who stood surety for Maina, would only be set free if he produces the defendant or the Federal Government sells Ndume’s N500million property, located at Asokoro, Abuja, used as bail bond. He is also expected to tender evidence of payment of the proceeds of the sale into the Federation Account before he is set free. The court had earlier fixed November 23 for Ndume to show cause why he should not forfeit the N500million bail bond. After the Judge’s pronouncement, Ndume was led out of the courtroom. The Point had reported that the Federal High Court in Abuja ordered the arrest of Maina, following his repeated failure to appear in court for the continuation of his trial. Justice Okon Abang revoked the bail the court earlier granted the defendant, and also gave the approval for the trial of Maina in absentia. Maina is facing a 12-count criminal charge preferred against him by the Economic and Financial Crimes Commission. He is being charged along with a firm – Common Input Properties and Investment Limited.
