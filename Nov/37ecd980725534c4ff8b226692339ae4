 LINUS CHIBUIKE THE All Progressives Congress said, on Wednesday, that no court order had restrained it from conducting its membership registration exercise. The party said it had investigated the purported court order and found out that no such order was ever granted, adding that no application was made to the court to warrant the granting of such order. This position was given in a statement signed by the Deputy National Publicity Secretary of the party, Yekini Nabena. The statement said, “In respect of the suit: KALU KALU AGU V. APC & ORS, FHC/ABJ/CS/736/2020, a Legal Officer was sent to Court on the 17th of November, 2020 to investigate the purported Court Order restraining the All Progressives Congress (APC) from conducting membership registration. “Upon our findings, we discovered that such Court Order was never granted by the Court, as no application was made to the Court to warrant the granting of such Order. “The evidence from the records of proceedings of Monday 16th November, 2020 shows that no order restraining the party from conducting the membership registration was granted in respect of the above suit or any suit relating to the APC. “The APC make bold to assert that the purported court order was erroneously reported and urge the general public to disregard. We equally call on our teeming party supporters, members and leaders to ignore the fake news and go about with their good work of repositioning the Party.”
