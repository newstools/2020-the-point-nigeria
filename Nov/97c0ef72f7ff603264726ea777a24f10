 BY LINUS CHIBUIKE A Federal High Court in Abuja has commenced the trial, in absentia, of a former Chairman of the defunct Pension Reform Task Team, Abdulrasheed Maina. Justice Okon Abang had, on Monday, ordered that the lawmaker representing Borno South Senatorial District in the National Assembly, Senator Ali Ndume, be remanded in Kuje Correctional Center. He gave the order, following Ndume’s inability to produce Maina, who is standing trial for alleged money laundering to the tune of N2bn, The Point had reported. Maina last appeared in court on July 2, 2020, during his legal team’s cross-examination of the sixth prosecution witness. Having failed to attend subsequent proceedings on the matter since September 20, 2020, the Judge revoked the bail earlier granted Maina in a November 18, 2020 ruling, ordered his arrest and ruled that the trial would be done in absentia. Abang had, on Monday, said Ndume, who stood surety for Maina, would only be set free if he produces the defendant or the Federal Government sells Ndume’s N500million property, located at Asokoro, Abuja, used as bail bond. At the resumed hearing on Tuesday, Maina was still absent despite the order that Ndume, who stood surety for him, be remanded in the Correctional Center. No lawyer was also in court to represent him or his company (the second defendant). The judge therefore closed the right of the former pension reform boss to continue the cross-examination of the sixth prosecution, following a request by the prosecuting counsel, Mohammed Abubakar. He also foreclosed the second defendant’s right to cross-examine the witness, saying “they have themselves to blame.” Maina is facing a 12-count criminal charge preferred against him by the Economic and Financial Crimes Commission.
He is being charged along with a firm – Common Input Properties and Investment Limited.
