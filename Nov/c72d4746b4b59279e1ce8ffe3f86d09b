* FOLASHADE KEHINDE A lady who was seen being dragged by a police operative into Ojuelegba Police Station in a video that went viral in the thick of the #EndSARS protests, narrated, on Friday, how operatives beat her black and blue and made her to remove her bra while they watched. The lady, Felicia Nkemakolam Okpara, who revealed that she was an orphan, had been dragged into the police station while trying to stream the policemen who were shooting to disperse #EndSARS protesters on Twitter, an act that was condemned by many Nigerians at home and abroad. She narrated her ordeal in the presence of her lawyer, Ridwan Oke, when she appeared before the Lagos State Panel of Inquiry on #EndSARS. According to her, she was dispossessed of her money and her phone was damaged by the policemen, who tortured and threatened to take her to Panti. “They told me to take off my bra. After taking it off, one of them went inside and brought a broken mop stick and used it on a man that was also arrested. After beating him, he went out and came back with anger and he started hitting me with the nozzle of a gun,” the 27-year-old victim said. “I was scared that he could pull the trigger. I think he realised what he was doing because he stopped and started using the gun butt to beat me,” she added. The lady also narrated how she saw popular Nollywood actor and Lagos lawmaker, Desmond Elliot, and realised he had come to the station because of her. According to her, Desmond Elliot gave her N6,000 to go home when she was released at about 10pm. Justice Doris Okuwobi adjourned the matter till December 4 for continuation of hearing, after admitting the photographs of her bruised body, medical report and damaged phone, as evidence.
