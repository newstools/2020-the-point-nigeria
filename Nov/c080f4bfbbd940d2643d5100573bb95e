 EKITI State Government has shut down five private health facilities for alleged sub-standard practice and use of unqualified medical personnel. The affected health facilities include Odunayo Medical Centre, Aye Ekiti; City Medical Laboratory, Ado Ekiti; Masterpiece Diagnostic Care, Ado Ekiti; Abundant Grace Hospital, Ado Ekiti; and Good Heritage Hospital, Ado Ekiti. The state Commissioner for Health and Human Services, Dr Oyebanji Filani, sealed the hospitals during an unscheduled visit to health facilities in some parts of the state. He expressed regret over the continued existence of such facilities in the state, despite regular monitoring and persistent warnings. Represented by the Director of Hospital Services and Training in the ministry, Dr Olusanya Adetoye, the commissioner particularly frowned at the way affected facilities were operating with incompetent staff in filthy environments. He described the situation as “inimical to the health of the people.” The commissioner said the government had met with proprietors of private health facilities in the state and warned them against the use of trainee nurses or auxiliary doctors in their operations at the risk of members of the public. According to him, the government will not hesitate henceforth to arrest and prosecute any auxiliary doctor and trainee nurses found to be working under the guise of being qualified professionals, whose activities posed danger to the life of people. – NAN
