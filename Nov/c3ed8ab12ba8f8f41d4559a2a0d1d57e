 LINUS CHIBUIKE INDICATIONS further emerged on Sunday that the Chairman of the All Progressives Congress in Nasarawa State, Philip
Schekwo, whose lifeless body was found close to his house, might have been assassinated. The state Commissioner of Police, Bola Longe, who confirmed the killing of the APC chieftain, said he was found dead with gunshot wounds, adding that findings pointed more at assassination than abduction. The gunmen had reportedly arrived Schekwo’s residence along Kurikyo Road, Bukan Sidi, in Lafia at about 11pm on Saturday. Eyewitnesses said the gunmen shot sporadically and forced their way inside the residence, adding that all attempts by the Chairman and his immediate family members to get the attention of security agencies in the state did not yield results. They were said to have made several frantic calls when the suspected assassins arrived the area and were shouting for help. The operation, which eventually led to the killing of the APC chairman, was said to have lasted for about one hour. “Family members said they disarmed his security guards, went to his bedroom and whisked him away. But there was no one to help. He was killed just close to the house, and his car key was left by his body,” one of the eyewitnesses, who did not want his name mentioned, said. But the police commissioner said, “From what we have seen since yesterday and the intensity of bullet marked on the wall of the house, including the forceful gaining of entrance into the house, it was clear it was much more than kidnapping. “We found his body near his house. Normally when kidnapping is carried out, it is for profit making. But this has shown that within a twinkle of an eye, the man was killed, no demand was made whatsoever.” “I believe it was assassination but that notwithstanding, we are going to carry out exhaustive investigation that will give us a clue to what has actually happened,” the police boss noted.
