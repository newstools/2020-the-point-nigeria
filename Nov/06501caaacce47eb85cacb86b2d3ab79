 BY ANDREW EKEJIUBA Nigeria Football Federation (NFF) target Eberechi Eze has pulled out of the European U21 Championship qualifier and will play no part when England U21 national team tackle Albania. The English Football Association confirmed on Monday that the Crystal Palace winger is one of three players who have withdrawn from the squad as a precautionary measure, the others being Marc Guehi and Rhian Brewster. Eze has been diagnosed with muscle tightness and will be assessed by the Eagles medical team when he returns to the club. The former Queens Park Rangers star played the last 17 minutes of the 3-1 win against Andorra last Friday, his 12th appearances for the Young Lions team since his debut against Italy U20s two years ago. Crystal Palace will be hoping their summer signing will return to normal training before the trip to Burnley on Monday, November 23. The 22-year-old has been included in all the matchday squads announced by manager Roy Hodgson in the new season and was handed minutes in eight games across all competitions. Eze was Palaceâ€™s standout performer against Leeds United before the international break, scoring and providing an assist in a 4-1 win.
