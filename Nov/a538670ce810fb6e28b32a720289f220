 … says Kamala Harris should have Nigerian DNA BY ABISOYE JOHNSON FORMER President Olusegun Obasanjo has congratulated the 46th United States President-elect, Joe Biden, and his running mate, Kamala Harris, on their projected victory at the keenly contested presidential election. In a congratulatory message, on Saturday, made available to The Point by his media aide, Kehinde Akinyemi, the former President described the election of the duo as a “victory of good over evil”. He tasked the newly elected President to restore confidence in the role of America as the largest economy in the world, which he said had a very significant responsibility for the peace, security, stability and progress of the world. Obasanjo lamented that the majority of the people had watched helplessly as the world was being pulled down. “Not that the world was perfect and equitable but it was reasonably predictable with some measure of rule of law and respect for international agreements and treatise,” he said. The former President, in the one-page letter, said he was reasonably sure that the first Africa-America female Vice President-elect of the US, Kamala Harris “will have some Nigerian DNA in her as most of those taken to the carribean from Africa went from Nigeria of today”.
