 … says ‘reports malicious, injurious’ ADELEKE ADESANYA AREWA Youths Consultative Forum has denied reports that its National President, Yerima Shettima, demanded the arrest of the Publisher of Ovation Magazine, Dele Momodu. Describing the report as fake, malicious and injurious, the AYCF said those peddling such rumours were working on an agenda aimed at tarnishing Shettima’s image. The Forum said this in a statement made available to The Point on Monday. It stressed that at no time did its President call for the arrest of Momodu for interviewing the Indigenous People of Biafra’s Nnamdi Kanu. The AYCF said, “Those spreading the fake news against our National President have been doing so for quite some months now and we are sure it is all politically-motivated and targeted at the good name our leader has built for decades as a fearless democrat. “The agenda of this shadowy group, which is bent on ridiculing the image and integrity of our National President, is to score cheap political points.” Legal Adviser of the group, Barrister Liman, who signed the statement, said he had already consulted widely with his associates on how best to take legal action against the group, once ongoing investigations were completed. “The AYCF’s National President, our own vocal Shettima Yerima, has been one of the leading lights in the advocacy for restructuring and good governance. He has also been an advocate of peace and dialogue and we wish to warn his detractors that their campaign of calumny will never change that,” the statement said.
