 THE Civil Liberties Organisation has warned the Federal Government about the negative consequences of the announced fuel price hike. The Nigeria National Petroleum Corporation announced on Thursday that petrol would now be sold for between N163 and N170, as the Petroleum Products Marketing Company, a subsidiary of the NNPC, increased the ex-depot price of Premium Motor Spirit, to N155.17 per litre, from N147.67 per litre. Reacting to this, the Chairman, Civil Liberty Organisation, Ogun State, Comrade Eniita Joseph, said the move might lead to the wrath of the masses. Eniitan, who spoke with our correspondent in a telephone interview, said, “To be candid, it is so bad to hear that this is happening at this time. I was so shocked to hear such an increment in pump price again, considering how terrible the economy of this country is now. “It is so bad, and it is going to affect the economy, even the down trodden, because it is difficult for people to feed themselves. Now that fuel price has increased, what do you expect? The multiplier effect of this will be so terrible because it is like they don’t want the common masses to survive.” “When things like this continue, it may lead to lawlessness in the country. CLO totally condemns the move. It is not welcome at all,” he said.
