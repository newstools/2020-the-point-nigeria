 BANYO TEMITAYO THE Nigerian Communications Commission has said plans have not been concluded for the deployment of the Fifth Generation (5G) network in Nigeria. The Commission noted that the Draft Consultation Document for the deployment of 5G, which had been uploaded on its website, defined the implementation plan for 5G deployment. This is contained in a statement signed by the Director of Public Affairs, NCC, Ikechukwu Adinde. The statement said, “The Commission wishes to draw the attention of the general public to the fact that the Commission has not concluded plans for the deployment of Fifth Generation (5G) network. “The Draft Consultation Document for the deployment of the 5G in Nigeria has been produced and uploaded on the Commission’s official website (www.ncc.gov.ng). This document defines the implementation plan for the deployment of 5G in Nigeria.” The Draft Consultation Document presents guidelines for the relevant areas of the technology and the expectations of NCC from the operators. The Plan also takes into account the expectations of all the stakeholders in the communications industry in Nigeria, according to the Commission. Recall that 5G trials were conducted in selected locations across Nigeria in 2019 to study and observe any health or security challenges the network might present. “The Commission also has an ongoing engagement with the academia, while at the same time funding 5G related research projects, all in a bid to ensure the nation is provided with the best in terms of research findings and policy input, to drive the implementation and deployment of 5G technology in Nigeria,” Adinde said. “These engagements are targeted at enabling the development of robust policies, which will put Nigeria in the best place to contribute maximally to the digital economy drive of the nation,” he added.
