 BY LINUS CHIBUIKE AMNESTY International, Nigeria, on Friday, reacted to a seven-day ultimatum, issued by the Centre for African Liberation and Socio-Economic Rights, for it to vacate the country or face severe consequences. While saying it was not the first time it would face such threats, AI maintained that despite threats to members’ lives, through faceless organisations and sponsored protests, it would continue to raise its voice whenever and wherever there was injustice. CALSER had, in a Wednesday briefing, described Amnesty International’s reports during the #EndSARS protest as jaundiced. Its convener, Princess Ajibola, gave the seven days ultimatum for the human rights watch dog to vacate Nigeria and warned that failure to do so would attract civil disobedience on the same scale as the violence that trailed the #EndSARS protests. In a statement, Amnesty affirmed its position as a human rights organisation, saying it was not affiliated to any government, ideology, interests, political, religious or commercial groups. AI said, “We have been working on Nigeria since June 1967. Despite threats to our lives, through faceless organisations and sponsored protests, we will not stay silent. In the face of efforts to evade responsibility or to smear our organisation, we will continue to raise our voices whenever and wherever we see injustice. “We will continue to call on the Nigerian government to use its authority and resources to investigate all allegations of human rights violations and abuses, including rape, torture, arbitrary detentions and unlawful killings.” It said the Nigerian authorities had the legal duty to ensure the protection of lives and properties of every person in the country. “Malicious threats will not deter us from continuing to speak against human rights violation and abuses by state and non-state actors,” Amnesty declared.
