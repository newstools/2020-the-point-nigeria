Dr. Tolu Ademujimi who led a team of the Health Commission to the meeting at ODSFA’s Caring Heart Games Village, Oda Road highlighted the benefits of ODCHS package in a comprehensive presentation, after which a to be formalised partnership interest was mutually expressed. “We will work out an agreement for a future partnership between the two government agencies, though this is a bit late for the new season consideration. “The NPFL starts in less than two weeks, there won’t be enough time to complete the paperwork and other logistics and as a result we have to carry on with other health plans for now,” Barrister Owanikin said. Sunshine Stars’ (ODSFA) Team Doctor, Dr. Babatunde Akinbinu was mandated to have further talks aimed at formalising an agreement of mutual benefits with the Health Commission.
