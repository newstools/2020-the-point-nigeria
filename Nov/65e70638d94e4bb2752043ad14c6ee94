* DIEGO Armando Maradona’s manager and friend said the legend ‘was tired and let himself die’ while the family around him was ‘tearing each other’s hair out.’ The Napoli and Argentina icon died on Wednesday at the age of 60 after numerous health problems and addictions that ravaged his life and career. “There’s an investigation into Diego’s death and people now point the finger at what could’ve been done, but that’s a concept that should be extended to his entire life,” manager Stefano Ceci told Radio Kiss Kiss. “Diego was always alone: people only ever thought about Maradona. Diego stopped being Diego when he turned 17. He was very difficult to deal with as a person, because he was fragile, full of insecurities, humble and good-natured. I have 20 years of wonderful memories. “Recently he was letting himself go, physically and mentally. I think he was tired and let himself die, he no longer really wanted to live. “The family chaos that surrounded Diego meant he never had real peace. Even now that he’s dead, they are still tearing each other’s hair out. “At least now he can be with those he loved the most, his mother and father. Now Diego is in peace.” Maradona was buried next to his parents in Buenos Aires.
