 BANYO TEMITAYO THE All Progressives Congress, on Sunday, said the Peoples Democratic Party had been rattled and disoriented by the recent courtesy visit by some APC Governors to former President Goodluck Jonathan. The Deputy National Publicity Secretary of the Party, Yekini Nabena, said in a statement that PDP should focus on picking up the pieces at a time the party “and its leadership are grappling with a crisis of confidence.” He said this while reacting to the PDP’s comment on the APC Governors’ visit to Jonathan. The National Publicity Secretary of the PDP, Kola Ologbondiyan, had said Friday’s visit by serving APC governors to the Abuja residence of ex-President Goodluck Jonathan was a confirmation and acknowledgement that Nigeria was better managed under a PDP-led administration. Nabena, however, said, “The Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) is obviously rattled and disoriented by the recent courtesy visit by some Governors of the All Progressives Congress (APC) to former President Goodluck Jonathan. “Chairman, APC Caretaker/Extraordinary Convention Planning Committee (CECPC) and Governor of Yobe State, Mai Mala Buni, led the APC delegation. “At a time when the PDP and its leadership are grappling with a crisis of confidence, one would expect the failed opposition to focus on picking itself up.” “As a party for all progressives, the APC on its part will continue to consolidate on its national appeal and acceptance,” he added.
