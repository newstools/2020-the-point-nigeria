 YOUTUBE child comedian, Emanuella Samuel, popularly called Emanuella, has built a house for her mother. The 10-year-old popular comedian on Mark Angel’s Channel, announced this on Instagram. She said her mother had told her she wanted a portable house, and that she was happy she was able to deliver it. While noting it was a Christmas gift to her dear mother, she promised to build a “mansion” for her next year. “I built this for you mom. For all the prayers; all the encouragement and support. Mummy, I know you said you want a portable house and this is it. But forgive me because I must complete your mansion for you next year. Don’t worry, it won’t make us go to hell; my super Christmas mummy. I love you,” Emanuella said.
