THE Nigerian Electricity Regulatory Commission has warned landlords to stop imposing outstanding electricity bills on new tenants. The commission said this in a tweet on Thursday by the Commissioner, Finance and Management Services, NERC, Nathan Shatti. He said a Landlordâ€™s outstanding electricity bill could not be enforced on a new tenant. This, he said, was in agreement with a court ruling that the bill of a previous tenant could not be enforced on a new customer. Before this directive, the practice has been that a new tenant, while moving into a new house, takes on the outstanding electricity bill in the apartment. This practice has been a source of controversy in the country with distribution companies disconnecting customers who failed to comply. But Shatti told new tenants, who were asked to pay the outstanding bills of their landlords, from now, to report the issue to the NERC for appropriate action.
