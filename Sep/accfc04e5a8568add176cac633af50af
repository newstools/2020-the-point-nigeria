THE All Progressives Congress Professionals in Oyo State has accused Governor Seyi Makinde of wasting the state’s resources on strategies to execute his ambition of running for vice-presidency under the Peoples Democratic Party in 2023. The professionals alleged, after a meeting in Ibadan on Friday, that Makinde had squandered over N7bn on PDP activities in the last six months. They said this just as the crisis rocking the South West PDP over the control of the party machinery deepens. Former Governor of Ekiti State, Ayodele Fayose, had warned Makinde a few days ago, to stay away from Ekiti PDP, in spite of the fact that he is a sitting governor. The governor also seems to have a running battle with the APC state chairmen of Lagos, Ondo Ogun and Osun, who have accused him of sidelining the zonal party structure and have reportedly taken sides with Fayose. “Governor Makinde has completely abandoned governance in Oyo State for his quest to extend his political control to the entire South-West, South-South and some states in the North-Central,” the Chief Convener, APC-P, Adekunle Lawal, said on Friday. According to the group, it is appalling that the Oyo Governor went as far as Niger State to seek political control with the state’s resources. Efforts to get the reaction of the state government were not successful as of the time of filing this report. Telephone calls to the Chief Press Secretary to the Governor, Taiwo Adisa, were not answered.
