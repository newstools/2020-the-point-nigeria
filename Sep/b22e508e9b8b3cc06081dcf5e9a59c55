SPECIAL Adviser to Edo State Governor on Media and Communication Strategy, Crusoe Osagie, has said that the All Progressives Congress is stirring controversy so that the authorities will shift the September 19 governorship election in the state. Osagie, who said this in a statement he issued in Benin City on Sunday, stressed that the Peoples Democratic Party was committed to enduring peace before, during and after the poll. The governor’s aide said, “APC leaders and gubernatorial candidate, Osagie Ize-Iyamu, are agitated because they are not ready for the election. They are convinced that they do not stand any chance in the forthcoming election. “They are behaving like some unserious and misguided university students who do not read, and when faced with examinations, they engage in anti-cult fights few weeks to the examination, so that the school authority will shift the examination.” He emphasised that “Edo State is peaceful as people are going about their businesses peacefully,” urging the APC candidate and his handlers to concentrate on their campaign.
