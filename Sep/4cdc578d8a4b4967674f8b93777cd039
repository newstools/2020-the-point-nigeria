THE Oyo State governorship candidate of the African Democratic Congress in the 2019 election, Senator Olufemi Lanlehin, has dumped the party for the All Progressives Congress. Lanlehin returned to the APC following what his loyalists called a collapse of an alliance that produced Seyi Makinde as Governor under the Peoples Democratic Party. The ADC, a few days ago, dissolved the Oyo State Executive Committee and appointed a caretaker committee, a decision said to have further infuriated members of Lanlehinâ€™s camp. Lanlehin, who represented Oyo South Senatorial District in the 7th Senate, held a meeting in Ibadan, with his supporters on their specific move on Monday, The Point learnt.
