LAWYERS, under the umbrella of the Nigeria Bar Association, Ilesa branch, Osun State, on Wednesday, protested alleged reckless abuse of judicial power and discretion by one of the Magistrates in the state, Mrs Habibat Basiru. The protesting lawyers stormed Ilesa Magistrate Court 2 and refused to attend to either pending or new cases. This development disrupted proceedings at the court while those who had cases or other businesses at the court returned home disappointed, as the lawyers refused to enter the court. The lawyers vowed not to appear before Magistrate Basiru for any case or business until she is transferred. The protesters, in a letter dated September 11, seen by The Point on Wednesday, demanded for the immediate transfer of Basiru over alleged abuse of judicial power/discretion since she started presiding over matters in the court. The letter, signed by the Chairman of NBA, Ilesa branch, Femi Fafowora; and Secretary, Adeniyi Abioye; titled, “Notice of Commencement of Boycott of Magistrate’s Court 2,” was addressed to the Chief Registar of the State High Court, Justice Muhammed Lasisi. Fafowora explained that the industrial action was embarked upon after an emergency meeting of the lawyers over an alleged stray style of Magistrate Basiru. The lawyers accused the female Magistrate of constant refusal to grant bail to accused persons without justification when such applications were not opposed by the prosecutor. They also alleged that Basiru often molested lawyers before clients during proceedings. They therefore demanded her immediate transfer, stressing that they would continue to boycott the court until their request is granted.
