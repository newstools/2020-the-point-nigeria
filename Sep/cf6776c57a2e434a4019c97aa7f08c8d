Earlier, First Minister Nicola Sturgeon said a new Covid-19 “tipping point” has been reached requiring new restrictions in Scotland. She told Good Morning Britain: “I’ve made a judgment that we are again at a tipping point with Covid. “I’m looking at data that alarms me, frankly, and if we don’t act now, urgently and decisively, then we might find Covid running out of control again.” Labour hit out at the Government over coronavirus today in PMQs. Keir Starmer said Boris Johnson’s explanation for why one out of eight children are off school due to coronavirus fears is ‘poor’. Mr Johnson said that the virus does not affect children badly when asked by the Labour Leader what preparations the government had made for outbreaks once schools reopened. The PM said that the government was doing ‘its best’ to get children tests. – mirror.co.uk
