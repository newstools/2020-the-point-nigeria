A Pastor of a church in Lagos, identified as Steps Enofe, has allegedly married a 15-year-old Junior Secondary School 2 student in Lagos. The pastor, who is said to be the Founder of the Spirit Of Grace Ministry, located at 8 Makinde Street, Idi-oro area of Mushin, reportedly got married to the teenager after his first wife parked out of his house. The Point learnt that the pastor had allegedly been defiling the teenager for over two years. A source close to the case, who spoke on the condition of anonymity, said, “Both the traditional and church wedding have taken place and the girl has moved into the man’s house. “The little girl, who is a member of the cleric’s church is his second wife. And this cleric went for an underage child after his first wife, and mother of four children packed out of his house and has refused every reconciliatory advance for over three years.” According to the family source, the girl’s father, who was not in support of the marriage, alleged that Bishop Enofe, started having sex with his daughter when she was only 13 years old. The teenager, it was learnt, started living with Bishop Enofe as his wife since August 28, 2020, after he had performed all traditional wedding rites to officially make her his wife. The pastor, when contacted by a member of an advocacy group, Advocate for Children and Vulnerable Persons Network, on the matter, reportedly insisted that he had the right to marry the teenager since her family members had agreed. He also warned the group to desist from interfering in the matter. As of the time of filing this report, the advocacy group had commenced plans to save the teenager from being violated further by the pastor.
