A Jos High Court, on Tuesday, dismissed an application by the Presidential Candidate of the African Democratic Congress in the 2019 election, Obadiah Mailafia, seeking to stop the Police from further harassing him after the interrogation by the Department of State Services. The Police had summoned Mailafia to appear at its Force Criminal Investigation Department Complex, Garki Area 10, on Monday, August 24, 2020 at 11am. But the former CBN Governor did not honour the invitation. “His lawyers got a court injunction that the Police should not harass him (Mailafia) again. This is because if the Department of State Services is handing a matter, the Police cannot be doing the same thing. If DSS has allowed him to go, the Police cannot arrest him again on the same matter,” a source close to Mailafia had told The Point. The DSS had, shortly after the video of the interview Mailafia granted Nigeria Info went viral, invited him to its Jos office. He was released the same day after about six hours of interrogation, but invited two more times for further questioning. Mailafia had said in the interview that he got his information about sponsors of the terrorists from some repentant Boko Haram fighters.
