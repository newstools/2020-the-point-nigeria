 MINISTER of Humanitarian Affairs, Disaster Management and Social Development, Sadiya Umar Farouq, is now married to the Chief of Air Staff, Air Marshal Sadique Abubakar, a year after viral posts on the social media on a rumoured wedding with President Muhammadu Buhari, a report by Daily Trust has said. The wedding Fatiha, according to the publication, held on Friday, September 18, 2020, at the Maitama Juma’a Mosque in Abuja as confirmed by multiple sources. The event was a private affair as one of the sources disclosed to Daily Trust that “very few people were invited to attend the wedding Fatiha because (of) the couple.” “Those close to them didn’t want to publicise the issue,” the source added. Abubakar and Farouq had been dating for “a while” as revealed by the source. “They have been in a relationship for a while and what happened on Friday has put to rest all the speculations about her relationship with President Muhammadu Buhari,” the source told Daily Trust. When contacted, a Presidency source, who asked not to be quoted, told The Point that the two were free to do what they liked as adults, but did not particularly refute the report. “I am not confirming to you that they are married. But if they are and it was not publicised, it is their wish. There is no law against it. Why not get in touch directly with the minister or the Chief of Air Staff?” the source said. Efforts to get the reaction of the minister were not successful as of the time of filing this report.
