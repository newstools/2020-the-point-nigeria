MEMBERS of the Academic Staff Union of Universities and Non-Academic Staff Union of Universities, on Monday, barred the Vice-Chancellor of the Lagos State University, Prof. Olanrewaju Fagboun, and the students of the institution from gaining access to the school’s premises. The union members were protesting the refusal to pay them the increment in salaries promised by the Lagos State Government, one year after. Governor Babajide Sanwo-Olu of Lagos State had directed tertiary institutions in the state to reopen on September 14, 2020. In this regard, 300 and 400 Level Students were to resume Monday, along with other members of staff. Schools had been shut, nationwide, for about six months, owing to the need to contain the spread of the novel COVID-19. The Point’s correspondent, who was at the gate of the institution at about 8am, saw union members turning back people and vehicles at the entrance, which caused panic, as pleas against the action were not heeded. A first year student of the university, who identified herself as Onyinye Okoro, said she was at the school to check what was going on, but was surprised to see the chaos. “The Government should answer the union members so that we can all resume according to the schedule. I have to leave this place now because I don’t want to be trapped in trouble,” she said. The VC of the institution, who also tried to prevail on the workers to explore dialogue and allow free flow of movement, could not also gain access into the premises. Efforts to get a reaction of the institution was not successful as of the time of filing this report.
