THE Edo State chapter of the Peoples Democratic Party has expressed gratitude to President Muhammadu Buhari for deploying adequate security to Edo State, ahead of the September 19 governorship election in the state. The Publicity Secretary of the party in the state, Chris Osa Nehikhare, gave the commendation when spoke to journalists on behalf of the Edo State PDP Campaign Council, on Tuesday, in Benin City. According to him, “the efforts, so far put in place by the Buhari-led government to ensure the security and safety of Edo people, before, during and after the election, deserve commendation.” Nehikhare stated, “With the massive deployment of men of the Nigeria Police Force, the Military, Nigeria Security and Civil Defense Corps (NSCDC) and other security agencies to Edo State to supervise Saturday’s election, we are confident that the election will be crisis-free. “President Buhari’s commitment to the safety and security of voters in the state will bolster confidence among voters and will ultimately impact positively on voter turnout.” The PDP spokesman urged voters in the state to come out en masse on election day, to reelect Governor Godwin Obaseki by voting the PDP. This, he said, would sustain the ongoing reforms across the various sectors of the state as well as the administration’s industrialisation drive.
