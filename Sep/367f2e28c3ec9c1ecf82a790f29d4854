A woman, Ifeyinwa Ezukamma, 40, has been chased out of her matrimonial home by her husband’s family for seeking justice for her eight-year-old daughter raped by her tenant. The incident took place in their Ogidi, Anambra State country home, she told reporters, adding that she caught the 57-year-old suspect in the act on July 23. She said the man had been violating her daughter since March, the News Agency of Nigeria reports. “I noticed an unusual noise and movement in the bathroom. So out of curiosity, I went to check if everything was normal. To my amazement, it was a tenant in our house, an old man, was having sex with my daughter,” she said. Ezukamma said her failure to heed her “compromised” husband’s warned not to pursue the case led to her being sent out of their matrimonial home. Child Right Brigade International (CRIB), an NGO, said the matter was reported to its office on August 12. CRIB said it would ensure that the suspect was charged to court and prosecuted. Ogidi Divisional Police Officer, Remigus Ekuri, confirmed the incident, saying the matter would be charged to court as soon as the medical report was available. – NAN
