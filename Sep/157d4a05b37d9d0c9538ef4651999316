THE reconciliation moves of the All Progressives Congress in Ondo State appear to be yielding positive results as a key official of the Governor Rotimi Akeredolu administration, who resigned from his cabinet shortly before the party’s primary election, reconciled with his boss at the weekend. The Point learnt that the former Secretary to the State Government, Ifedayo Abegunde, who had resigned, after the Deputy Governor, Agboola Ajayi, initially joined the Peoples Democratic Party, returned to support the Governor, following elders’ advice. He had, shortly after his resignation, reportedly faulted the process that produced Akeredolu as governor in 2016, saying he and some others helped him. He, however, reconciled with the Governor after the party leaders waded in, in their continued efforts at getting aggrieved members on board in the final stage of campaign for the October 10 Governorship election. Our correspondent gathered that a meeting was held to this effect on Sunday at the Government House in Akure, the state capital. Abegunde had, after his resignation, supported the campaign of Segun Abraham, who was a governorship aspirant of the party. Abraham, however, eventually declared support for Akeredolu after he lost the primary. Confirming the reconciliation, the Ondo State Commissioner for Information, Donald Ojogo, said the SSG did not leave the ruling party when he resigned. According to him, Abegunde’s return to his leader is a display of uncommon courage, which shows how deep in thoughts and altruistic he is. The development, the commissioner said, also showed how magnanimous and kind-hearted the Governor is. This move, according to observers, has strengthened the Akeredolu camp, ahead of the governorship poll.
