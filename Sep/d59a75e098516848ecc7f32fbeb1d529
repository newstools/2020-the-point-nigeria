A bus with registration number GGE 972 GE collided with a fast-moving commuter train in Lagos on Monday, when it suddenly veered off the road onto the track, around PWD, in the Oshodi area of Lagos State. No lives were lost as eight passengers escaped death narrowly. Confirming the incident, the Director-General, Lagos State Emergency Management Agency, Femi Oke-Osanyintolu, said, “The agency received distress calls on the above. Upon arrival at the scene, it was discovered that a passenger bus with registration number GGE 972 GE, had veered onto the train tracks while crossing the rail at PWD inward Oshodi, Lagos. “The bus was then dragged along for a stretch of the journey before the train managed to come to a complete halt. Subsequently, the agency was able to successfully extricate the passengers and note that there was no loss of life.” According to him, the passengers were provided with on the spot medical care and discharged. The DG, however, urged members of the public, especially commercial drivers, to always exercise caution and obey traffic rules to prevent unnecessary accidents.
