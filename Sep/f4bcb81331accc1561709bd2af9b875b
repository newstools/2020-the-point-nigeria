The building, belonging to Excel College, is located at Number 15, Ansarudeen Street, Ejigbo. Director-General of the Lagos State Emergency Management Agency, Femi Oke-Osanyintola, confirmed that the building collapsed due to “visible distress.” He said, “Information gathered from some officials of the school revealed that the building had previously shown signs of distress and the school was planning to renovate and refortify the structure. “The three-storey building has two wings conjoined.
