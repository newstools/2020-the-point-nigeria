A woman who is dating her cousin posted intimate pictures of them in a bid to change stigma of incest. Taking to Twitter to reveal their unusual relationship, they wrote: “Don’t let y’all being cousins stop you from being in love.” “Can we change the stigma of incest?” the woman wrote online. “I shouldn’t be limited to who I love because we’re related. I’m just happy and in love, just so happen to be my cousin. What’s the deal? Y’all need to get over who I … Cousin or not.” Going by the name of Lil Marche on Twitter, she hit back at many who slammed their relationship as “wrong”. Many felt very strongly about the relationship, with one follower saying “there is a special place in hell for that”. Another said,  “I just want to know how your parents are okay with that.” But responding to the negative comments, Lil Marche said she wasn’t bothered and was “in love” with her cousin, reports the Sun. In one image, they even stripped down to their underwear (Image: Twitter) “I don’t care what anyone says. You’re all not going to shame me – I’m in love. No need to be ashamed of it,” the lady said. Lil Marche also revealed how the cousins seemed to have been in love for years and claimed they had to hide it from their loved ones. She added, “I remember growing up, we had to hide our love from our family. Sleepovers was too lit. Now, we grown and we don’t gotta hide. “Blood can’t make us any closer but I’m so glad I fell in love with my cousin. And y’all are lying if you saying you never thought about … your cousin or thought your cousin is cute.” Other images of the couple showed their tongues touching as they peered into the camera. It is not known exactly where the cousins are from. – mirror.co.uk
