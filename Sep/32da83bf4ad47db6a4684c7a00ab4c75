THE candidate of the Peoples Democratic Party, Godwin Obaseki, has won the September 19, 2020 governorship election in Edo State. He won, landslide, polling 307,955, against the All Progressives Congressâ€™ Osagie Ize-Iyamu, who clinched 223,619 votes. The historic win, according to analysts, may have finally put godfaterism in the back seat, in Edo politics, and by extension, Lagos, and the whole of Nigeria. Obaseki has made history as a godson who confronted his godfather, headlong, and emerged victorious, in spite of what many described as Federal might. All eyes are now on the October 10 Ondo State Governorship election, where the incumbent Governor Rotimi Akeredolu is up against Eyitayo Jegede of the PDP, and the deputy governor of the state, Agboola Ajayi, of the Zenith Labour Party.
