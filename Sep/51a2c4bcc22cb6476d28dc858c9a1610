THE Edo State Media Campaign Council of the All Progressives Congress has congratulated Governor Yahaya Bello of Kogi State on the Supreme Court validation of his election. In a special message, on behalf of the party’s candidate in the Edo governorship election, Osagie Ize-Iyamu, the APC hailed Bello’s triumph, stating that it had put the Edo APC in a victory mood, in the final run-up to September 19. The statement, signed by the Chairman of the Council, John Mayaki, said, “Your victory, at the apex court, couldn’t have come at a better time.  It has put our party in joyous and victory mood to triumph on September 19”, while urging the governor to regard the judicial endorsement as a renewed call to service, for the Kogi people. “It is all about service. It is all about adding value to our people. It is all about pushing positive changes, that our great party, the APC, is passionate about,” the statement said. The campaign council noted that the Kogi PDP defeat would send their ‘Edo cousins’ into fresh panic, adding however that any party that took the people for granted, as the Edo PDP, deserved a good lashing at the polls. “We are coasting to victory on September 19.  The Edo people cannot wait to throw out this woeful Obaseki regime.”
