THE General Overseer of the Synagogue Church of All Nations, Prophet T.B Joshua, has advised Barcelona skipper, Lionel Messi, not to leave the club “bitter and offended”, owing to the disagreement between him and the management. Messi is currently pushing for a free transfer to reunite with Pep Guardiola, his former manager, at Man City. But his release clause must be paid if he must leave Barcelona this summer. The 33-year-old believes he has left Blaugrana, but the Barca board insists he is still their captain. The Barca Number 10, who has played for Barcelona for almost 20 years, informed the Catalan club last week of his intentions to leave immediately. He missed the club’s training on Monday and Tuesday. His father and representative, Jorge, arrived at Barcelona on Wednesday morning to meet with the Barcelona chiefs, including, president Josep Maria Bartomeu, to discuss his son’s future. However, advising the football star on his verified Twitter handle on Wednesday, TB Joshua said, “It is not good advice for Lionel Messi to leave Barcelona bitter and offended. It is impossible to establish a healthy relationship with a person who left a previous relationship bitter and offended. This is my candid advice to Messi. History is our boss.”
