AS collation proceeds in the Edo State Governorship Election, voters have said it is hard to predict who will win the election, as the candidates of the two main political parties seem to have gone in to the poll, neck-to-neck. The voters, who spoke to our correspondent in different polling units, however, warned the two parties – All Progressives Congress and Peoples Democratic Party – against last minute rigging during collation. They said the consequences of such might be more than what security agencies could contain. While a voter in Ward 4, Oredo Local Government Area of the state, who identified himself as Audu Abdul, said everything was peaceful in his area but for “a report that a woman was beaten by APC thugs”, others alleged that there was manipulation going on in some units. “I don’t think Obaseki will tell anyone to beat anybody. It could be the thugs doing what they are doing without any directive from anywhere,” Abdul told The Point. Another voter, Irene Abudu, said she was going back home quickly to avoid what might happen after collation. She envisaged that thugs might be difficult to control when results were not going in favour of their paymasters. “I have voted. So I am on my way home. I don’t want to stay outside more than necessary. Anything can happen. This is Edo. My neighbour just called to say that they are rigging in her ward and that the atmosphere is tense,” the secondary school teacher said. However, analysts have said results trickling in shows there may be a pointer to surprises in places hitherto regarded as strongholds of each of the parties. Governor Godwin Obaseki is seeking re-election as the Peoples Democratic Party candidate against APC’s Osagie Ize-Iyamu.
