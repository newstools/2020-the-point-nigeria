RESEARCHERS from ZScaler have warned about 17 dangerous apps that can steal SMS messages, contact lists and device information. The apps were found to contain a type of malware called Joker. In a blog about the findings, ZScaler researcher Viral Gandhi explained, “Joker is one of the most prominent malware families that continually targets Android devices. “Despite awareness of this particular malware, it keeps finding its way into Google’s official application market by employing changes in its code, execution methods, or payload-retrieving techniques.” The apps include translation programmes, PDF scanner and messaging apps. Thankfully, Google has now removed the 17 apps from the Google Play Store, although they had already been downloaded 120,000 times. Based on the findings, the researchers are urging Android users to be careful about which apps they install on their smartphone. Mr Gandhi added, “We recommend paying close attention to the permission list in the apps that you install on your Android device. “Always watch out for the risky permissions related to SMS, call logs, contacts, and more. Reading the comment or reviews on the app page aslo helps identify compromised apps.” The 17 dangerous apps All Good PDF Scanner Mint Leaf Message-Your Private Message Unique Keyboard – Fancy Fonts & Free Emoticons Tangram App Lock Direct Messenger Private SMS One Sentence Translator – Multifunctional Translator Style Photo Collage Meticulous Scanner Desire Translate Talent Photo Editor – Blur focus Care Message Part Message Paper Doc Scanner Blue Scanner Hummingbird PDF Converter – Photo to PDF All Good PDF Scanner – Mirror.co.uk
