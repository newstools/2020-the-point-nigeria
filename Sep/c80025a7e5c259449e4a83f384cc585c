 PRESIDENT of the African Development Bank, Akinwumi Adesina, has visited Nigeria to say thank you to President Muhammadu Buhari and all Nigerians for standing solidly behind him during the struggle for his re-election. Adesina was re-elected with 100 per cent regional and non-regional votes at the Bank’s last Annual meeting, after he was cleared of all allegations by whistleblowers towards the end of his first tenure.  President Buhari congratulated him and gave reasons for supporting him. The President said, “I have told so many people why I backed you. In 2015, during your first term, you were a Minister with the Peoples Democratic Party government, and I was of the All Progressives Congress. But you are a good Nigerian. “So, I recommended you the first time. You proved to be competent, you made us proud, and I recommended you the second time.” Thanking Nigerians and the President in particular, Adesina said, “When I came in June, you received me, and I shared my successes, and the difficulties facing me. You listened, and said you would stand by me, and you did.  “You not only stood behind me, but also beside me. No greater honour for a man than for his Commander-in-Chief to be his Supporter-in-Chief, and his Defender-in-Chief.”
