THE Federal Government has waived import duty payable on some inputs used for the production of banknotes by the Nigeria Security Printing and Minting Company Plc. The Government, however, re-introduced an ad-valorem excise structure on spirits and wines. The revisions were contained in a circular signed by the Minister of Finance, Budget and National Planning, Zainab Ahmed. The circular, seen by The Point, said the excise duty on spirits, wines and cigarettes would be based on both ad-valorem and specific excise structures following the adjustment. The Federal Government has also recalibrated the specific excise structure for levying excise duty on other tobacco-based products. It said in the circular that this would effectively ensure the products are brought into the countryâ€™s excise net. Ahmed said the revisions were to be implemented with immediate effect. The finance minister added that the revisions would also supersede the circulars of March 6 2018, and February 7, 2019. She noted that the development was in accordance with the Customs, Excise Tariff and Consolidation Act, which empowered the President to impose, vary or remove any import duty or modify the schedules to CETA.
