THE Peoples Democratic Party won, on Saturday, in the polling unit of the former National Chairman of the All Progressives Congress, John Odigie-Oyegun. The Governorship candidate of the PDP, Godwin Obaseki, won in the unit, polling 109 votes, against Osagie Ize-Iyamu of the APC, who got 40 votes. Recall that Oyegun, who is Adam’s Oshiomhole’s immediate predecessor in the party, did not endorse Ize-Iyamu for the governorship election.
