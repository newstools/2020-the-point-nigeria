THE Commissioner of Police in Ogun State, Edward Ajogun, on Tuesday, paraded six robbery suspects operating in military uniform. The suspects allegedly specialise in robbing passengers on the Lagos-Ibadan expressway. The suspects – Ikechukwu Alore, Ifeanyi Emmanuel, Chibueze Kingsley, Obiora Michael, Elias John and Vincent Magnus – were fished out and arrested in their different hideouts within and outside Ogun State by operatives of the Special Anti – Robbery Squads. Ajogun, who paraded them before reporters at the Police Command Headquarters, Eleweran, said the gang leader, Obiora Michael, had sustained bullet wounds in his abdomen, right hand and thigh during an encounter with SARS operatives. The Police chief added that Obiora was traced to his home in Ajangbadi area of Lagos State on September 17, where his wife was treating him. He had lied to his wife that he sustained the injuries in a road accident. The police commissioner warned criminals to steer clear of the state. Obiora, who disclosed that he “hustles” at Alaba International market, Lagos, told The Point that he regretted his action, saying he had earlier left the gang because of the way they were shortchanging him with proceeds from robbery operations only to go back to them.
