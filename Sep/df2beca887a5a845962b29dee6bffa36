A former staff of a first generation bank, Oreoluwa Adesakin, has been sentenced to 98 years imprisonment by an Oyo State High Court for stealing N49million and $368,000 from her employer. Justice Muniru Olagunju, who delivered the judgment, said the court found the woman guilty of financial fraud against her employers to the tune of N49,320,652.32, and additional $368,203 belonging to the bank which she converted to her personal use. According to the spokesperson of the Economic and Financial Crimes Commission, Wilson Uwujaren, the convict was prosecuted by the Ibadan Zonal Office of the EFCC, on a 14-count charge, bordering on stealing, forgery and fraudulent accounting. One of the charges against her read: “That you Oreoluwa Adesakin sometime between the months of May, 2013 and November, 2013, at Ibadan within the Ibadan Judicial Division, whilst being a staff of a bank stole the sum of N25,974,116.13 from your employer,(name of bank withheld).” She pleaded not guilty to all the charges, which necessitated her trial. Prosecution counsel, Usman Murtala in arguing his case, presented all vital documents and witnesses, which nailed the convict. The judge noted that the EFCC amassed a pool of incontrovertible evidence against the convict and did a diligent investigation and prosecution. He pronounced Adesakin guilty of all the charges, sentencing her to seven years in prison without an option of fine on each of the 14 counts, which will run concurrently. Apart from the jail term, the convict is also to restitute to the Bank, through the EFCC, all the money she stole.
