Protest broke out in Osogbo, capital of Osun state on Tuesday evening after some officials of the state Joint Task Force allegedly caused three persons to die in an accident during a chase.
It was gathered that the suspected Yahoo boy, identified as Remi was driving a car when the security operatives sighted him and others who boarded the vehicle with him and started chasing them.
The JTF officials were shooting sporadically while the chase lasted.
Gripped by panic, Remi, the driver, was said to have lost control of his vehicle and rammed into a ditch beside the road.
One of the four persons were said to have died on the spot while others were rushed to a hospital in Osogbo by eyewitnesses. It was later gathered that two persons gave up the ghost in the hospital.
Immediately the crash occurred, the JTF officials were said to have fled the scene while shooting on thin air to scare away angry sympathisers.
