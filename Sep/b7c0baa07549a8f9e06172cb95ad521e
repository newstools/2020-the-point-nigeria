 THE Police Command in Sokoto State has confirmed the arrest of Baffa Tafida, who allegedly circulated a video on social media while sexually assaulting a girl. The girl was assaulted in 2017, but the video was allegedly released by the suspect a few weeks to the girl’s marriage slated for October. The marriage was called off as a result of the viral video circulated by the suspect. The Command’s spokesperson, ASP Muhammad Sadiq, confirmed to newsmen on Tuesday that Baffa was detained for further investigation over the issue. The mother of the victim, (name withheld), had earlier told newsmen that the principal suspect sexually abused her daughter sometimes in 2017 when she was 16 years old. The victim’s mother alleged that the suspect stored the video clips for three years with the intention of destroying her daughter’s life. ”The suspects shared the clips to my daughter’s suitor along with other online groups,” she said. According to her, marriage arrangements have been concluded for her daughter, scheduled for Oct. 17, this year, when Baffa allegedly released the video of him sexually abusing the girl. She said that the ugly development made the would-be groom withdraw from the proposed marriage. The victim’s mother added that the situation had devastated the life of her daughter as she could hardly eat nor sleep. A week ago, Dr. Adamu Kasarawa, the Commandant of disbanded state Hisbah, told the newsmen that the commission had investigated the matter, and the principal suspect and his two friends would be handed over to relevant authorities for prosecution. Other suspects connected to the case were Umar Abubakar and Mas’ud Gidado-Bodinga all residents of Sokoto. The News Agency of Nigeria also reports that Governor Aminu Tambuwal through his spokesman, Muhammad Bello, had ordered a full investigation into the matter, for suitable actions. – NAN
