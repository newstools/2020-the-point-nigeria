AS collation of results in the Saturday Governorship election in Edo State proceeds, former Senate President Bukola Saraki has urged the people of the state to protect their votes and not get carried away. He said this, while noting that the election had entered its crucial stage, after the conclusion of the voting exercise in the Saturday election. Saraki said in a series of tweets, “The on-going #EdoDecides2020 is getting to the crucial stages. I urge the good people of Edo State not to get carried away but to protect their votes. “The enthusiasm and patriotic conduct of the good people of Edo State must not be thwarted or subverted by any @inecnigeria official, either permanent or ad-hoc; or any security personnel, no matter the rank.” “Nigeria’s glory is more important than the huge ego of politicians. And so @inecnigeria and security officials must work to protect Nigeria’s image and not to satisfy the whims and caprices of some power-hungry politicians,” he also tweeted. The voting was largely peaceful but with pockets of violence and hijacking of electoral materials in certain areas like the Orhionmwon and Egor Local Government Areas of the state.
