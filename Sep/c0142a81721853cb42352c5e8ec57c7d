… as Kwanwaso, Ganduje, Obi, Uzodinma storm Edo THE last days of campaign for the Edo State Governorship seat seems to have been devoted to woo the non Edo indigenes domiciled in the state. The PDP kicked off the scrambling for non-indigenes’ votes with the coming of the former Anambra State Governor and vice presidential candidate in the 2019 elections, Peter Obi, who appeared at the party’s rally in Orhionmwon axis of the state where there is a large concentration of Igbo speaking people. Again, the PDP campaign council has also welcomed to the state, a former Kano State Governor, Rabiu Kwankwaso, who led the campaign targeted at the Arewa community across the state in a bid to convince them to vote for PDP. On the side of the APC campaign were two prominent northerners, also from Kano – former Governor Ibrahim Shekarau and incumbent Governor Abudullahi Ganduje. On ground to speak to the Igbo community on the APC side was Governor Hope Uzodinma of Imo State. The coming in of the mentioned party leaders to seek the support of non indigenes in the state is a testimony that the election is not about Edo people alone, analysts told The Point. According to them, it is estimated that non-indigenes constitute about 20 per cent of the voting population in the state.
