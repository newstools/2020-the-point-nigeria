THE candidate of the African Democratic Congress in the September 19 governorship election in Edo State, Mabel Oboh, has congratulated Governor Godwin Obaseki of the Peoples Democratic Party for emerging victorious at the poll. Noting that Edo now needs to heal and “smile again”, Oboh said she accepted the outcome of the poll because it was not about the candidates that contested in the election but about the people of Edo State. She said, “I would like to congratulate Obaseki for winning this election. Edo people have decided and I am happy to accept this decision. This is not about the candidates that contested in this election but about the people of Edo State. “I am always very willing to serve my people in any capacity. There is much to do for our people. Edo now needs to heal and smile again. “I want to use this opportunity to thank all the people that voted for ADC, the media personnel for covering this election in a very fair manner, the security agencies for carrying out their duties effectively. The leaders, elders, executives and members of ADC, who worked so hard to see the well awaited election through. “A special thank you to my DG jessica Inneh and my deputy, Reuben Edokpayi, for keeping the ball rolling for the short period that I was indisposed. “This is actually the beginning of my pledge to serve my people.”
