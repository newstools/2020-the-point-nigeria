Police prosecutor, Idoko John, informed the court that the defendants posed nude and took pictures on July 25, 2020, at about 12:30pm, at the Osun-Osogbo shrine, in Osogbo. Idoko said they desecrated the sacred river goddess’ shrine and insulted the traditional religion. He said they posted the porn video made on social media. When arrested and kept inside a police cell, the prosecutor alleged that the six defendants damaged the louvres of the Ataoja Estate Police Station. All the allegations are contrary to and punishable under Section 516, 233, 517, 204, 249(d) and 451 of the Criminal Code CAP 34 vol. II, laws of Osun State, Nigeria 2002, The Point reports. The accused persons pleaded not guilty to the eight count-charge slammed against them. Their counsel, Tunbosun Oladipupo urged the court to grant them bail. But the prosecutor objected the bail of the alleged persons, stating that the act was capable of breaching the peace of the state, and adding that if they were granted bail, there would be a breakdown of order. He added that the allegation was an economic sabotage to the state government because the scene of the act was a source of economic revenue to the state. He therefore said granting the defendants bail might lead to jungle justice, given that the scene of the act was a sacred religion centre. Magistrate F.I Omisade remanded the accused persons and adjourned the case till September 17 for ruling on bail.
