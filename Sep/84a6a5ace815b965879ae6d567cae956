 The Federal Competition and Consumer Protection Commission has opened an investigation into the conduct of dominant Pay TV service providers in Nigeria. The Commission, in a statement signed by the Chief Executive Officer, Babatunde Irukera, noted that over the past 24 months, it had conducted investigation, pursued legal action in court, and secured an injunction pre-empting price increase in the industry. The FCCPC also said it had entered specific orders regarding a provider, engaged in periodic surveillance and monitoring, and more recently inquired into a purported tax increase by at least one Pay TV Service Provider. The investigation, according to the commission, aims to address concerns as well as to resolve consumer dissatisfaction with Pay TV services. The statement, obtained by The Point, said, “The scope of the inquiry includes, but is not limited to questions about unfair dealings, unreasonable and manifestly unjust contract terms, abuse of market power, colourable pricing practices and other otherwise obnoxious or illegal conduct. “Operators are invited to familiarise themselves with the FCCPA and statutory clarifications of their obligations to the FCCPC under S.104 in addition to, and or irrespective of any obligations to other regulators. “The Commission will continue to pursue initiatives and efforts that promote and ensure fairness to all.”
