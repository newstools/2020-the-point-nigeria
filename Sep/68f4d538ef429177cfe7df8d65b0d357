THE Attorney-General of the Federation and Minister of Justice, Abubakar Malami, has said his non-appearance before the Justice Ayo Salami-led Panel of Inquiry is based on constitutional reasons. The panel is investigating activities of the Economic and Financial Crimes Commission under the watch of its suspended Chairman, Ibrahim Magu. Magu had asked the panel to invite his main accuser, Malami, so he could provide evidence. He had been accused of ethical misconduct, and diversion of recovered funds, among others. However, Malami, in a statement by his media aide, Umar Jibrilu Gwandu, said he did not appear before the panel as a witness for “purely constitutional” reasons, noting that it was not based on any ulterior motive.” He said, “In establishing propriety or otherwise of the presence of the Attorney-General of the Federation and Minister of Justice whose responsibility is to hold constitutional order, one must root same within the constitutional provisions. “The terms and wordings of invitation extended to the Attorney-General of the Federation and Minister of Justice to Justice Ayo Panel of inquiry against Magu runs contrary to the Constitutional provisions.” The AGF added, “The Office of the Attorney-General of the Federation and Minister of Justice is, by the provision of the Constitution and extant laws, empowered to serve supervisory role. “In the case of the Economic and Financial Crimes Commission (EFCC), the Attorney-General of the Federation and Minister of Justice has been discharging the role effectively.”
