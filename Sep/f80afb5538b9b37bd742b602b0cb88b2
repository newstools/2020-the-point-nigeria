GOVERNOR Godwin Obaseki of the Peoples Democratic Party has defeated the All Progressives Congress in his polling unit, with 80 votes against APCâ€™s 51 votes. The governor voted at Emokpae Model Primary School, PU 19, Ward 4, Oredo Local Government Area, in the Edo governorship election still ongoing. Obaseki had criticised the conduct of the election in the state, noting that the Independent National Electoral Commission should have been better prepared for the election. He complained about having to wait for over one and a half hours on the queue, owing to the fact that the card reader was slow.
