THE camp of the Deputy Governor of Ondo State, Agboola Ajayi, is upbeat as a Senior Special Assistant to Governor Rotimi Akeredolu on Political Matters, Andrew Ogunsakin, resigned from the Governor’s administration on Friday. Ogunsakin’s resignation, which is coming barely 23 days to the governorship poll in the state, might be a pointer to some surprises that political watchers might not have envisaged in the battle ahead, analysts said. The SSA, reliable sources told The Point, will be defecting to the Zenith Labour Party, to support Ajayi’s campaign. “If he did not drop his resignation letter when he did, he would not be able to participate in Ajayi’s flag-off campaign,” the source said. In his resignation letter, the SSA, who was a close associate of former Governor Olusegun Mimiko, said, “The call of my constituents on me to join the train to actualise a common aspiration different from what is offered by your government and your party stands at the root of my decision to quit at this point. “Being an appointee, this will necessarily conflict with the performance of my duty to you, hence my resignation. “l thank your Excellency for the opportunity afforded me to serve the good people of Ondo State as SSA, for the period I was in office.” Ogunsakin was the Zenith Labour Party candidate for Okitipupa/Irele Federal constituency in the 2019 general election before he defected to the All Progressive Congress.
