… Demands public apology from Ojougbo THE Senate, on Tuesday, denied a statement credited to the Executive Director, Projects, of the Niger Delta Development Commission, Cairo Ojougbo, alleging that its members received N20m each as COVID-19 palliative from the Commission. The Spokesperson for the Senate, Ajibola Basiru, in a statement he signed, challenged the NDDC ED to release the details of beneficiaries or tender a public apology. Ojougbo had, in a newspaper interview, alleged that the NDDC gave N20m to each senator and N15m to each House of Representatives member as COVID-19 palliative. However, in a statement titled, “NDDC boss says senators got N20m, reps N15m each for COVID-19 – a disclaimer,” Basiru said, “The Senate views with grave concern a statement credited to Dr Cairo Ojougboh, the Executive Director, Projects of the NDDC, who alleged that National Assembly members received varying sums of money as COVID-19 palliative. “The Senate hereby disclaims the allegation in its entirety. The Senate categorically denies that any Senator collected the sum of N20 million or any sum whatsoever from NDDC as COVID relief fund or for any purpose whatsoever.” He added, “The Senate challenges Dr Ojougboh to publicly provide evidence of his claim and list the names of the Senators he allegedly gave the alleged sum. “Failure to provide evidence of his claim, the Senate hereby demands an immediate retraction and a public apology from Dr Cairo Ojougboh.”
