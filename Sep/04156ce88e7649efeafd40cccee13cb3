RE-ELECTED Governor of Edo State, Godwin Obaseki, on Tuesday, heeded the advice of former President Olusegun Obasanjo, by extending a hand of fellowship to the former Chairman of the All Progressives Congress, Adams Oshiomhole. Obaseki, who made the move after receiving his Certificate of Return from the Independent National Electoral Commission, along with his Deputy, Phillip Shaibu, told Oshiomhole that the “fight” was over. “On a special note, I want to use this occasion to call on the former chairman of the APC, Comrade Adams Aliu Oshiomhole, that the fight is over,” he said. The Point had reported that Obasanjo, on Monday, advised the governor to be magnanimous in victory and extend a hand of fellowship to the other candidates who had lost in the September 19 Governorship election. Obaseki urged the former labour leader to join him in building the house, “where he was part of laying the foundation.” “We have no malice. The only thing we disagree on is the approach of moving Edo forward,” he clarified, while also calling on the APC candidate in the election, Osagie Ize-Iyamu, to join in the efforts at developing Edo State. “We are one family in the pursuit of providing services and public vote for our citizens,” he said. The governor noted, “I want to put it on record that the election of September 19, 2020 has been adjudged as one of the best conducted elections in terms of it being free and fair. “Our citizens have decided that for now, they trust us more with the affairs of leadership. It does not mean that they did not have a role to play. It does not mean that they are not part of a family. “So I am using this opportunity to extend a hand of fellowship to my brother, Pastor Osagie Ize-Iyamu, and his other colleagues in the APC, to join us so that we can move Edo State forward.”
