FORMER Deputy National Chairman of the Peoples Democratic Party, Olabode George, has advised Governor Godwin Obaseki of Edo State to disregard what he called conspiracies of “little men” as the state prepares for the September 19 governorship election. In a release issued on Tuesday, titled, “Why Godwin Obaseki should be re-elected”, George said Obaseki was a good man with a kind heart who had devoted the last four years to the service of the good people of Edo State, with selflessness and sacrifice. Speaking against the background of a broadcast by the National Leader of the All Progressives Congress, Bola Tinubu, where he claimed that Obaseki was not a democrat, George said, “Godwin Obaseki is humble, a democrat, a bridge-builder, a go-getter who is not deterred by the tantrums and the shenanigans of little men who go about trying to distort his image and his incredible achievements in Edo.” He said the people of Edo State believed in his hard work and observable developments. George said, “He is a man of ingenuity and quick, natural accommodating nature. Governor Obaseki should disregard the conspiracies and the charades of little men who go about playing dirty politics, sponsoring thuggery, flaming the embers of destruction. “Godwin Obaseki definitely deserves a second term. He has earned it. He has worked for it. And most importantly, he has the support and the goodwill of all Edo people.” He urged the people of Edo State to give Obaseki another four years to complete what he had started, saying, “His good works and achievements stand for him and Edo people should vote for him.”
