The convicted violators were sentenced to community service or asked to pay a fine.” The FCT police boss enjoined traditional, religious and community leaders to complement the effort of the government to contain the spread of the virus by using their influence to educate and enlighten the people on the need to observe the lockdown order. He noted that the command had intensified effort to protect lives and property in the FCT, adding that 43 suspects were arrested during the lockdown. According to him, items recovered from the suspects include an AK47 rifle, eight locally-made pistols, one Tavor rifle, and one Dane gun.

In compliance with the directives of the Inspector-General of Police, the command said it has focused its crime-fighting effort on armed robbery, kidnapping, ‘one chance’ robbery, theft, and house-breaking.
