Greece on Saturday announced a three-week extension to its coronavirus lockdown to April 27 as it reported nine more deaths. “Difficult weeks lie ahead… If we relax our efforts, the virus will destroy us,” Nikos Hardalias, deputy minister for civil protection, told a daily briefing. The health ministry’s special spokesman for the virus, Sotiris Tsiodras, announced 60 new confirmed cases, bringing the national total to 1,673, and nine deaths in the last 24 hours. AFP reports that people have now officially died of the virus in Greece, with an average age of 74 years, Tailored said. The Greek government is seriously concerned that the public will ignore travel restrictions and flock to the countryside and islands ahead of Orthodox Easter, which falls April 19. Hardalias said there would be “zero tolerance” for those trying to bypass restrictions. -AFP
