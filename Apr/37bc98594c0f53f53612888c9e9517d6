The Deputy Inspector General of Police (Operations), Mr. Abdulmajid Ali, has donated palliatives worth more than N1.5million to some less privileged Nigerians. Ali, who is toeing the line of the President Muhammadu Buhari-led administration and other philanthropists in giving succour to Nigerians from the ravaging Coronavirus pandemic, distributed the palliatives to residents of Lugbe area in the Federal Capital Territory, Abuja, on Thursday. The Police boss, who derives pleasure in putting smiles on the faces of Nigerians and adding values to mankind, runs a Non-Governmental Organisation, MJ Foundation, having many orphanages in Kontagora,   Niger State and some other parts of the country. The Foundation has also been giving scholarships, health care services and empowering many Nigerians over the past decade. A statement by Ali’s Personal Assistant, Olumuyiwa Adejobi, a superintendent of police, stated that the relief items, which were  shared under strict observance of the COVID-19 preventive measures by the immediate family members of the DIG led by his philanthropic and kind-hearted wife, Hajjia  Idiat Ali, included rice, beans, beverages, fruits and clothing. The Police boss, however, also seized the opportunity to educate and appeal to the residents of Lugbe Area of the FCT and other Nigerians that COVID-19 is real, adding that every Nigerian  should collaborate with the Federal Government and governments at all levels to fight the pandemic, which is inimical and threat to our existence and national development. He further felicitated with the Islamic faithful on the Ramadan period and prayed that Almighy Allah (SWT) heals our land of the pandemic.
