Kano State Private Health Institutions Management Agency on Friday ordered the 300 private health facilities in the state to operate within their registered competencies or risk closure. The agency also advised laboratories and scan centres in the state to stop operations for now and threatened to shut down private hospitals with inadequate personal protective equipment. Executive Secretary of the agency, Dr. Usman Eti, said that the directive was part of measures taken by the state government to ensure that private health practitioners were not exposed to the raging COVID-19 pandemic. According to Eti, “The directive is being monitored in conjunction with the Nigerian Medical Association, Nigerian Association of Nurses and Midwives and Pharmaceutical Council of Nigeria. “Private isolation center with PPE and standard settings should be designated, so as to have options and avoid the Lagos scenario. Because some must look for private care. “Telemedicine and all electronic channels shall be employed to give care with minimal patient contact. “All diagnostic centres, laboratories as well as scanning centres have been advised to close down.” He said that the agency in collaboration with other stakeholders, including the coronavirus task force team in the state would scale up surveillance to ensure compliance. As of Thursday night, the Nigeria Centre for Disease Control said 73 of the total 981 COVID-19 cases were reported in Kano State.
