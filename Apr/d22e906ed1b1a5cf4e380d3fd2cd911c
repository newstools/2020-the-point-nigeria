Unlike Governors and top government officials who announced that they had tested negative for COVID-19 not too long after testing positive for the virus, Governor Nasir El-Rufai of Kaduna State said on Wednesday, that he was still positive. The Governor, who had announced to Nigerians on March 28, that he had tested positive for Coronavirus, told the public via his Twitter handle that they should not believe any fake news contrary to his submission. He disclosed this in an update he gave after chairing a virtual meeting of the Kaduna State Executive Council. “Earlier (on) Wednesday 10am-2pm, I took a few hours during isolation to chair a virtual meeting of the State Executive Council. I haven’t been cleared of COVID-19 yet and (I) will personally announce when confirmed negative. Ignore all fake news even if you like it, ” the Governor said.
