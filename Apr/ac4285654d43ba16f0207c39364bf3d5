The Chinese government, on Tuesday, said that authorities in Guangzhou resorted to strict measures against Nigerians and other Africans stranded in the region because they were found to be more vulnerable, given the number of those who tested positive to the Covid-19 virus. Chinese Ambassador to Nigeria, Mr. Zhou Pingjian, said this during a media briefing with Foreign Affairs Minister, Geoffrey Onyeama, on the ill-treatment of Nigerians and other Africans stranded in China. Scores of Nigerian students and businessmen in Guangzhou were evicted from their apartments and hotel rooms by Chinese authorities. Guangzhou is home to one of China’s largest African communities and has become a hub for African traders buying and selling goods to the continent. Online videos show the victims lamenting their inhumane treatments by the authorities who they say have not provided them with alternative food or shelter since their eviction. While maintaining that the measures deployed to contain the importation of Covid-19 were not properly communicated, Pingjian said the prevalence of the Covid-19 disease among foreigners, especially Nigerians, necessitated the action by the Guangzhou authorities. The envoy said according to the current statistics of the outbreak of the Covid-19 in Guangzhou, Nigerians and other Africans were most vulnerable, hence the measures was meant to protect them. He noted that the relationship between China and Nigeria was a strong one, adding that China would do anything to protect that relationship as “China has zero tolerance for discrimination.” The United States at the weekend accused Chinese authorities of “xenophobia” toward Africans, after coronavirus cases among Nigerians unleashed a wave of evictions in the city of Guangzhou. The Speaker of the House of Representatives, Femi Gbajabiamila, also expressed displeasure over the inhuman treatment meted out to some Nigerians by the Chinese authorities in Beijing.
