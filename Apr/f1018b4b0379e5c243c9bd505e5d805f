Scores of persons from Adamawa have accused the police of extorting them while travelling from Lagos and Ogun, where they claimed about 5000 of them have lost their jobs due to the outbreak of the deadly COVID-19 in the country. The affected Adamawa indigenes alleged that they had to bribe security operatives on the highways before being allowed to return to their homes in the state. Narrating his ordeals, one of the affected workers, who pleaded anonymity, told our correspondent at the Bali quarantine facility in the state that about 5000 workers from Adamawa lost their jobs at a Chinese-owned ceramics factory in Ogun State recently. He, however, alleged that the bribe being demanded from them by the police on the highways was making it impossible for the other sacked workers to return to the state. According to him, “I can confirm that about 5000 of us from Adamawa State are part of the 20,000 staff of a Chinese ceramics factory located in Ogun State. “I can also confirm to you that out of our number, only a few of us are still on their way back home. “That is why we want to plead on their behalf, that our government should do something to fast track their arrival because policemen are extorting us on the highways.” He added, “For instance, some of us have not been back home here in the past five years; as such, we don’t have valid national identity cards; and because of it, police will force you to part with at least N1000.” Speaking during a visit to the facility, Chairman of the state’s Covid-19 Containment Committee, who is also the Secretary to the State Government, Bashir Ahmad, told the returnees that the state government was aware of their predicament. He assured them that prompt action would be taken by the state government to facilitate their easy return home. The SSG advised them to endure the 14-day mandatory quarantine, assuring them that they would soon be integrated into normal society.
