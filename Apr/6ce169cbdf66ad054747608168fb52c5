The Peoples Democratic Party has criticised President Muhammadu Buhari over Monday’s nationwide broadcast on the raging coronavirus pandemic. The main opposition party said Buhari failed to offer solutions to the COVID-19 challenge confronting Nigerians. The PDP in a statement by its spokesperson, Kola Ologbondiyan, expressed disappointment that Buhari failed to offer post-lockdown stimulus to Nigerians in the private sector. According to the statement, “The PDP is appalled that President Buhari, in his Monday’s COVID-19 address, again, failed to offer decisive solutions to protect Nigerians from the deadly pandemic. “We express disappointment that President Buhari did not offer any post-lockdown stimulus to assist Nigerians in the private sector, whose business had been crippled by the lockdown and are now faced with the burden of workers’ salaries and business refinancing. “Apart from the elementary lockdown and failed palliative showboating, President Buhari did not offer a decisive solution regarding the production of drugs, testing kits and management of equipment to safeguard Nigerians, despite the huge resources at the disposal of his administration. “Buhari did not address the demands by Nigerians to end his administration’s political parochialism and engage competent hands, including indigenous researchers, equipment manufacturers, and pharmaceutical, medical as well as virology experts to infuse home grown therapeutic solutions in the overall effort.”
