Governor Abdullahi Ganduje of Kano State has sacked his Commissioner for Works and Infrastructure, Engr. Mu’azu Magaji, with immediate effect. The commissioner, according to Kano State’s Commissioner for Information, Mallam Mohammed Garba, was sacked as a result of his unguarded statements on the death of the late Chief of Staff to the President, Mallam Abba Kyari. He said as a public servant, the commissioner should have respected his office and refrained from any action that would tarnish its image. “The action of a public servant, personal or otherwise, reflects on the government, and, therefore, the Ganduje administration will not tolerate people in official capacities engaging in personal vendetta or otherwise,” he said. The statement added that the late Chief of Staff had led a life worthy of emulation by serving his country to the best of his ability. The commissioner was reported to have previously wished that Kyari never returned to office after he tested positive for COVID-19 a few weeks ago. In his Facebook post, after Kyari’s death, the commissioner reportedly sent out several posts, with one saying, “Win, win, Nigeria is free, and Abba Kyari ya mutu a cikin anoba…” Another post said, “Nigeria is bigger than any individual… While praying for the President’s late support staff, ours is to prevent a repeat of his non-accountable domineering era.” Kyari’s remains were laid to rest in Abuja on Saturday morning.
