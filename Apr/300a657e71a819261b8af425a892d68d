Mohammed, son of Nigeria’s former vice president Atiku Abubakar, has now tested negative for coronavirus. This is coming just as Raymond Dokpesi Jnr, the chairman of DAAR Communications Plc, owner of AIT and Raypower, disclosed that he has tested positive for COVID-19. Mohammed said he would soon be discharged from the Gwagwalada Specialist Teaching Hospital in Abuja, where he has been receiving treatment in the past 40 days. He was moved to the hospital on March 19 after testing positive for the virus. “I have just received my second consecutive negative result. My discharge is currently being processed, and I hope to be home this evening,” he said from the isolation centre. Recall that Atiku Abubakar had disclosed on March 22 that his son had tested positive for the virus. “My son has tested positive to coronavirus. @NCDCGov has been duly informed, and he has been moved to Gwagwalada Specialist Teaching Hospital in Abuja for treatment and management. I will appreciate it if you have him in your prayers. Stay safe, coronavirus is real. -AA,” he had tweeted. As of April 26, there are 1273 confirmed cases in Nigeria. 239 patients have been treated and discharged while 40 deaths have been recorded, according to the Nigeria Centre for Disease Control.
