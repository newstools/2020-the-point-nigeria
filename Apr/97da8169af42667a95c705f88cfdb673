United Kingdom Prime Minister Boris Johnson has been moved to intensive care at the hospital after his coronavirus symptoms “worsened”, Downing Street has said. A spokesman said he was moved on the advice of his medical team and is receiving “excellent care”. The British Broadcasting Corporation reports that Johnson has asked Foreign Secretary Dominic Raab to deputise “where necessary”, quoting the spokesman. The prime minister, 55, was admitted to hospital in London with “persistent symptoms” on Sunday evening. The Queen has been kept informed about Johnson’s health by No 10, according to Buckingham Palace. A No 10 statement read: “The prime minister has been under the care of doctors at St Thomas’ Hospital, in London, after being admitted with persistent symptoms of coronavirus. “Over the course of [Monday] afternoon, the condition of the prime minister has worsened and, on the advice of his medical team, he has been moved to the intensive care unit at the hospital.” It continued: “The PM is receiving excellent care, and thanks all NHS staff for their hard work and dedication.” Raab said there was an “incredibly strong team spirit” behind the prime minister. He added that he and his colleagues were making sure they implemented plans the PM had instructed them to deliver “as soon as possible”. “That’s the way we’ll bring the whole country through the coronavirus challenge,” he said. Chancellor Rishi Sunak said his thoughts were with the prime minister and his pregnant partner, Carrie Symonds, and that Mr Johnson would “come out of this even stronger”. Labour leader Sir Keir Starmer described it as “terribly sad news”. “All the country’s thoughts are with the prime minister and his family during this incredibly difficult time,” he added. Mr Johnson was initially taken to hospital for routine tests after testing positive for coronavirus 10 days ago. His symptoms included a high temperature and a cough. Earlier on Monday, he tweeted that he was in “good spirits”.
