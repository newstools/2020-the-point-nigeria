The African Democratic Congress has described the passing of the Chief of Staff to the President, Mallam Abba Kyari, as a big loss for the President Muhammadu Buhari administration, in particular, and the nation in general. The ADC said this great loss called for deep reflection on the part Nigeria’s leaders, adding that “it is a wake up call for leaders to understand that they must make the best of the time in their hands to write their names in gold.” In a condolence message, signed by the party’s National Publicity Secretary, Yemi Kolapo, ADC said Kyari was indeed the strong man of the current administration, adding that, though his style might not have resonated well with many, he definitely excelled in all his assignments, including the last one, as the President’s Chief of Staff. ADC said, “He demonstrated a good grasp of political chess and served his boss with commendable loyalty. He will be remembered as one of Nigeria’s most influential politicians. “He will be sincerely missed in Nigeria’s polity, especially as this painful exit makes history as one of the very few high profile deaths from the unfortunate Covid-19 pandemic currently giving governments sleepless nights all over the world. “ADC condoles with the President, the All Progressives Congress, the late Chief of Staff’s immediate and extended families, the people of Borno State, and indeed all Nigerians, over this painful loss, and prays that Allah forgives him his shortcomings and grants him Aljanah Firdaus as he is laid to rest today.”
