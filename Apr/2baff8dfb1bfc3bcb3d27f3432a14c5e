President Muhammadu Buhari, on Monday, approved the withdrawal of $150m from the Sovereign Wealth Fund, for distribution to the three tiers of government. The minister of Finance, Budget and Planning, Zainab Ahmed, who disclosed this on Monday, said the amount would be withdrawn from the Stabilisation Fund component of the SWF. She spoke in Abuja, during a press briefing on fiscal policy measures to tackle the impact of the Coronavirus pandemic on the economy. According to the minister, it became necessary to withdraw the amount in order to cushion the negative effect of decreasing revenue on the federation account. The Sovereign Wealth Fund, which is a brainchild of former Minister of Finance, Olusegun Aganga, was signed into law via the Nigerian Sovereign Investment Authority Bill, on May 26, 2011, by the former President Goodluck Jonathan administration, creating the Nigerian Sovereign Investment Authority. Based on the Santiago principle, the SWF comprises three investment baskets â€“ the Nigeria Infrastructure Fund; the Future Generations Fund: and the Stabilisation Fund.
