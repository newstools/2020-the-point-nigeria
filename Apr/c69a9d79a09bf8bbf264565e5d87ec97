Zamfara State Governor, Bello Mohammed Matawalle, has extended the closure of the state’s borders for another two weeks. Matawalle has also approved the setting up of mobile courts for instant prosecution of the violators of the lockdown. The governor equally announced the suspension of this year’s Ramadan Tafsir, Taraweeh and Ittikaf across the state. He announced these measures in a statewide broadcast on Thursday, assuring that the state government would ensure the enforcement of the directives for the safety of Zamfara State’s citizens. The governor said, “What we are doing is in tandem with international good practices concerning the current pandemic ravaging the globe. “Although we do not have a single index recorded here in our state, we are worried today with the developments in our neighbouring states of Sokoto and Katsina. We cannot afford to be complacent.” He warned that any vehicle caught trying to penetrate the state’s borders or leave the state would be confiscated and the owner of the vehicle prosecuted. Governor Matawalle, however, said that people were still free to travel anywhere within the state and conduct their normal business. “In all these, however, I enjoin you to observe the best practices of social distancing, use of face masks and hand sanitisers,” he added. He said the state government had provided two isolation centers, which it had equipped. “We have also ordered ventilators and test kits, some of which have already arrived and will be unveiled soon,” the governor said. He further said that the state government had ordered food stuff and essential commodities for distribution to citizens to cushion the effects as the fasting period commences.
