Tension gripped residents of Jos, the Plateau State capital, on Friday, after a man, who alighted from a vehicle from Ibadan, Oyo State, slumped and died at the Angle D/Vom junction. Eye witnesses said that the incident resulted in people scampering to safety from the scene as many kept safe distance from the corpse. A witness said that the man arrived along with his wife in a car carrying chickens, adding that the woman had been isolated by some people. Members of the Jos South health unit, who were at the scene, declined to give any comment. They were, however, seen blocking people from going near the corpse. Recall that Plateau State recorded its first COVID-19 case on Thursday. The index case was said to be a returnee from Kano State.
