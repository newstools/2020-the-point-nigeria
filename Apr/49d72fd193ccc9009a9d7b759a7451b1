Governor, Willie Obiano of Anambra State has relaxed the coronavirus lockdown imposed on the state. The Governor, who announced the new rules on Covid-19 restrictions in a state broadcast on Saturday, also asked churches to commence full activities. There had been restrictions on church activities for 14 days, as part of measures to contain the spread of Coronavirus. According to the Governor’s directives, worshippers must, however, wear face masks and observe the World Health Organisation’s guidelines during worship. He added that people should also wash their hands regularly, avoid handshakes, use hand sanitizers, and observe social distancing. Movements around the state, he said, were not restricted, even as he stressed that all boundaries remained closed. He said, “All food and drug markets in the state are to open with immediate effect. “I will meet with market leaders on Monday, 27th April, for further discussion. When to re-open the schools as well as when civil servants will be allowed to go back to offices will be announced soon.”
