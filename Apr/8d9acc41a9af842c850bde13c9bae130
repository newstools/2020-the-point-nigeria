Former Deputy National Chairman and member, Board of Trustees of the Peoples  Democratic Party, Chief Olabode George, has made  a direct donation worth N160million to the needy in Lagos State. This is to cushion the harsh effect of the current lockdown ordered by the Federal Government to halt the spread of Coronavirus in the country. The aid, which included cash, cows, bags of rice, groundnut oil, bottled water and beans were distributed to the needy, irrespective of their political party affiliations. George also donated N10million to the Lagos State Chapter of the Peoples Democratic Party to assist the party in providing relief to its members during this lockdown. The PDP chieftain, who commended the Federal and various state governments for their efforts in combating the dreaded Coronavirus, said as a statesman he believed that government couldn’t do it all alone, saying  that was why he provided relief to the needy in Lagos State. He said his direct aid to the needy had nothing to do with politics and should not be given any political colouration. George, who is also the Atona Oodua of Yorubaland, said he would also reach out to the needy in the South West, just as he called on Nigerians to cooperate with the Federal Government in its efforts to combat the spread of Coronavirus. He prayed that the Almighty God would guide aright President Muhammadu Buhari in his efforts to curtail the spread of the deadly virus.
