The World Health Organisation said on Wednesday that it was reviewing what impact the United States’ decision to halt funding would have, adding that it was looking to others to help fill financial “gaps”. “WHO is reviewing the impact on our work of any withdrawal of US funding and will work with our partners to fill any financial gaps we face and to ensure our work continues uninterrupted,” WHO chief Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus told a virtual news conference in Geneva. US President Donald Trump had said earlier on Wednesday that his Government would halt funding to WHO, noting that the Organisation had failed “in its basic duty” in its response to the Coronavirus outbreak.
