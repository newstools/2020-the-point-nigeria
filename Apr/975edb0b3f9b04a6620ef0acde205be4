 â€¦ to pay N100, 000 fine each Nollywood comedy star, Funke Akindele of the Jenifa fame, and her husband, Rasheed Bello, aka JJC Skillz, have both been sentenced to 14 days in community service for flouting the Lagos State lockdown order. The couple will pay a fine of N100, 000 each, and go into isolation for 14 days in an undisclosed location, going by a ruling given by Mrs. Yewande Aje-Afunwa of the Lagos State Magistrates court, Ogba. Funke Akindele was arrested after hosting a birthday party in honour of her husband during the lockdown to check the spread of coronavirus. The popular actress faced criticisms after her husband posted the video of the party on his Instagram live feed on Saturday. She has, however, apologised to Nigerians for her actions.
