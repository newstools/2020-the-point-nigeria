.After being declared by Gov Obaseki as a functional isolation center Osemwengie Ben Ogbemudia, Benin Barely two days after the Governor of Edo State, Godwin Obaseki, announced that the state government had completed the setting up of the Stella Obasanjo Hospital as an isolation center for confirmed cases of COVID-19 in the state, the state government has now reversed itself with a sudden shutdown of the facility. Our correspondent gathered that visibly shaken health workers were driven away from the health facility on Thursday on the orders of the government. No explanation has been put forward for the action. This development, residents argued had further marred the state government’s handling of the coronavirus disease in the state, and raised huge doubts on the additional claims of the governor on available facilities, especially the installation of 28 ventilators, a figure that has been disputed by private organisations and health workers in the state. Since Edo State recorded its index case of the coronavirus disease, accusations of dishonesty, incompetence, and lack of accountability have trailed the government’s preparations. Earlier this week, it was compelled to offer a rebuttal to a widespread claim that it was politicising relief efforts through local officials who, according to the people and other CSOs, were compiling names and bank account details of only residents supporting the second term ambition of the governor for the relief packages. The shutdown of the Stella Obasanjo Specialist Hospital is alleged to be part of a scheming by the state government to receive funds from donors under the pretext that the state government lacks adequate facility. Unlike what obtains in other states, items received from donors in Edo are allegedly treated with official secrecy, with no one able to tell what was received and how they were deployed.
