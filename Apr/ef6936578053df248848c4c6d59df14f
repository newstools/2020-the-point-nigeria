Community pharmacists have threatened to withdraw their services if they are continued to be exposed to the deadly coronavirus in the performance of their duty. The Association of Community Pharmacists of Nigeria, in a statement, warned that they would down tools “If it becomes obvious that continuing rendering our services would be detrimental to our personal health and that of our family members without adequate attention from the government.” The pharmacists’ body claimed that over 60,000 community pharmacists in the country were currently being exposed to COVID-19 with the current trend of community spread of the virus. The ACPN lamented that despite its members playing important roles among the health care professionals, government had not thought it needful to capture the contribution of Community Pharmacists in the ongoing fight against COVID-19. It alleged that community pharmacists were being ed from among health care practitioners to receive protective gear in the performance of their duties. “The valuable service that Community Pharmacists and their teams provide to communities, and their significant contribution to alleviating the great pressure on health systems during the current coronavirus / COVID-19 pandemic, is now more evident than ever,” ACPN National Chairman, Dr. Samuel Adekola said.
