The Nigeria Immigration Service, on Sunday, said it had received 13 Nigerians who arrived from Lome, Togo at Seme-Krake joint border post. NIS spokesman, Mr Sunday James disclosed this in a statement in Abuja. He said the returnees were technicians who went to install industrial machines in Togo. According to James, the 13 returnees have been handed over to officials of the Ministry of Health in Lagos for medical test. “Also for isolation in line with NCDC directives on medical procedures for new arrivals into the country to curtail the spread of coronavirus,” he said. James said that Seme-Krake was a major entry-exit point into and out of Nigeria, bordering Benin Republic, adding that NIS was not taking chances in enforcing strict border patrol. He said that the service would apprehend anyone who wanted to circumvent the approved routes, hence the numbers that have been turning up through the Seme-Krake border post since the border closure.
