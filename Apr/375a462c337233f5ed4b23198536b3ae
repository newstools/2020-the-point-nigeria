The Lagos State Government says it will commence a house-to-house Coronavirus case identification to detect possible cases in the state. According to a statement from the state Ministry of Health on Thursday, the COVID-19 case identification campaign, tagged, “Community Active Case Serach” is expected to run, in the first instance, for two weeks. It quoted the Commissioner for Health, Prof. Akin Abayomi, to have disclosed this during a joint Ministerial Press briefing on COVID-19 intervention in Lagos on Thursday. The commissioner said officials carrying out the exercise could be identified with COVID-19 outbreak Response tags as well as a letter from the Local Government. “In the coming days, some of our health workers will be moving around in pairs to administer an electronic questionnaire at homes and healthcare facilities to make enquiries about symptoms of cough, cold and fever,” he said. “This is in a bid to intensify our search for possible cases of COVID-19 in different communities across the state. I implore you to give them your maximum support by providing accurate information that would help in containing this pandemic quickly, ” he added.
