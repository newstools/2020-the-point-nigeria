A Chief Magistrate’s Court in Ilorin, the Kwara State capital, on Thursday, sentenced four persons to 14 days self-isolation for attempting to escape with one Oladayo, a COVID-19 patient, at Sobi Isolation Centre in Ilorin. Chief Magistrate Bio Solihu, also ordered the convicts to pay N20,000 fine each in addition to the isolation sentence. Solihu also ordered the Civil Defence officers, who arrested the violators, to liaise with the officers of the correctional centre and the state’s COVID-19 Technical Committee to ensure that the convicts were isolated. The convicts are Sadiq, Isiaka, Hakeem, and Wasiu. They were convicted of violating the state government’s restriction of movement order and the rules guiding patients at the isolation centre. The Prosecutor, Inspector Nasir Yusuf, urged the court to try the offenders summarily since they had pleaded guilty. Yusuf said the patient was an inter-state driver who came from Lagos to Ilorin.
