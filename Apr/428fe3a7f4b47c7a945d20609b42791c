The police have launched a manhunt for some notorious political thugs accused  who were responsible for the disruption of the nationwide bye elections conducted in 2017. The elections were to fill the vacant positions in the National Assembly, which came about as a result of the death of some members and nullification of the victory of some others by the various Elections Petition Tribunals. It was gathered that the current administration is bent on extending the fight against corruption to all levels, including all political parties, to forestall a reoccurrence in the future. According to sources, no fewer than eight (8) members of a gang of political thugs, who were used by highly influential politicians in Nigeria during the 2017 elections  are now being hunted by security agents throughout the country. It was also learnt that the thugs allegedly led by one Olayinka Sulaimon Oladayo, a strong member of one of the strong political parties in Lagos with strong connections with high ranking politicians, were used to  perpetrate thuggery and disruption of many elections in 2017. Oladayo,  who is said to be mean and fond of getting away without  being reprimanded, is now being hunted for by security operatives, sources said.
