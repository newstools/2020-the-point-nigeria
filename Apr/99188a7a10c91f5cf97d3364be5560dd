Katsina State Government, on Wednesday, lifted the suspension order on Friday congregational prayers following a meeting held with religious leaders, traditional rulers and security agents in the state. In a statement, Secretary to the State Government, Dr. Mustapha Inuwa, said the suspension of Friday prayers had been lifted with immediate effect. Inuwa, however, added that the prayers have to be conducted under some stipulated health/security guidelines. According to him, the Jumma’at Imams should avoid prolonged sermons in order to discharge their followers within a short period. “People are also strongly advice to maintain social distancing and strictly adhere to all rules and regulations. As provided by the health experts in fighting the contagious disease,” he said. Recall that about two weeks ago, Katsina suspended Friday prayers and church services across the state, as the police enforced the suspension as part of precautionary measures taken to curb the COVID-19 pandemic. Only last week, one person was killed and 90 others arrested as police clashed with youths in the state over the arrest of an Imam who defied government’s directives and held the Friday congregational prayer. Sources say some police officers had stormed the residence of the Imam, Malam Hassan, and took him for questioning to the dislike of the locals. Angered by the police action, irate youths and his followers stormed the Divisional Police headquarters in Kusada in a move to forcefully release him, resulting in the clash, the burning down of the police station and the death of one person.
