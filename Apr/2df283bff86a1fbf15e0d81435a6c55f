The police in Ogun have arrested a 43-year-old man, Joshua Abraham, for allegedly stealing a new born babyâ€™s placenta. The suspect was arrested following a report at Ibafo Police Station by one Raliha Zakara, the grandmother of the baby. The grandmother had reported that the suspect, who is her close neighbour, came to the hospital where her daughter was delivered of the baby and pretended to be the father of the new baby. She alleged that the suspect later demanded for the placenta from the nurse on duty and it was given to him. On getting the placenta, he was said to have taken it away on the pretence that he was going to bury it. But when the grandmother got to the hospital and was informed that the suspect had taken away the placenta, she quickly confronted him. He was said to have told the grandmother that he had buried the placenta but when she insisted that she should be taken to where he buried it, it was discovered that he had hidden it and had only buried a dead rat at a spot. Upon the report, the DPO Ibafo Division, Superintendent Abiodun Ayinde, detailed detectives to the scene, where the suspect was arrested. It was discovered that the suspect had once been arrested for defrauding a police officer and a pastor of huge sums of money under the pretence of procuring Canadian visa for them. It was also discovered that the matter is still pending in court. He has since taken the detectives to where he hid the placenta and it has been recovered. The state Police Public Relations Officer, DSP Abimbola Oyeyemi, said that the Commissioner of Police, Kenneth Ebrimson, had directed that a thorough investigation be carried out and that the suspect be charged to court as soon as possible.
