 … Nigeria demands release of victim The Chairman, Nigerians in Diaspora Commission, Abike Dabiri-Erewa, said, on Wednesday, that the Lebanese government had promised to institute legal action against a citizen of the country, Wael Jerro, who advertised a Nigerian woman for sale on Facebook. Jerro’s Facebook post, on a group, “Buy and Sell in Lebanon”, which displayed the passport of a Nigerian lady, Busari Peace, had gone viral a few days ago. He wrote in Arabic: “Domestic worker from Nigeria for sale with new legal documents. She’s 30 years old; she’s very active and very clean. Price: $1,000.” While speaking on the issue, Dabiri-Erewa said, “As of Wednesday, 22nd, the Lebanese Ministry of Labour has issued a circular condemning the action of Mr. Wael Jerro, as completely unethical, in contravention of Lebanese Laws and against the principles of Human Rights. “The circular further stated that legal action will be constituted against him for human trafficking before the competent judicial authority by the Ministry, in line with its statutory responsibility. “The Nigerian mission in Lebanon has also demanded an immediate hand over of the victim to the mission unconditionally and, in good health. “NIDCOM will continue to follow up on the matter.”
