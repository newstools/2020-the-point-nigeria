Thirty four Lagos residents on a physical exercise along the Gbagada-Oworonshoki Expressway have been sentenced to one month community service and 14 days quarantine. They were arrested and arraigned before a Yaba Magistrate’s Court by the state government for contravening the Federal Government’s 14-day lockdown order to check the spread of coronavirus in the state. The 34 accused residents were arraigned on a one-count charge of violating government’s social distancing directive. On Tuesday, pictures of the joggers, who had gathered in large numbers on the highway to work out, had surfaced on the social media. They pleaded guilty to the one-count charge against them and accordingly sentenced. The court also ordered that they should be quarantined for 14 days at the Infectious Diseases Hospital, Yaba, or any other place designated by the government.
