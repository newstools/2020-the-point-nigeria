Two of the 12 new coronavirus patients in Osun State, who sneaked into the state from Lagos State, have died. They are the only COVID-19 related deaths recorded in the state so far. The state had only one active case left, after discharging 17 patients earlier, before recording another 12 on Saturday. Governor Adegboyega Oyetola confirmed the deaths in Osogbo on Sunday evening while briefing newsmen on the status of COVID-19 in the state. Oyetola refused to disclose the identity of the deceased and assured that they would be properly buried in accordance with the National Center for Disease Control protocols. He said the deceased are from Ile-Ife and Ede. The Governor said three health workers in the state, who have been on the front line of the battle against the disease, are among the 12 new cases.

Oyetola cautioned residents of Osun not to receive visitors at this critical period and appealed to indigenes of Osun who are not in the state at the moment to remain where they are until the pandemic is defeated.
