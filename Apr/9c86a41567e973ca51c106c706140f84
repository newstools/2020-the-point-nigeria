Nigeria Centre for Disease Control, on Thursday, warned Nigerians to prepare for the transmission of the coronavirus to almost all the 36 states of the Federation. Nigeria has so far recorded a total of 407 confirmed cases in Lagos, FCT, Osun, Kano, Edo, Oyo, Ogun, Katsina, Bauchi, Kaduna, Akwa Ibom, Kwara, Delta, Ondo, Enugu, Ekiti, Rivers and Niger. NCDC Director-General, Dr. Chikwe Ihekweazu, said on Sunrise Daily, a live programme on Channels Television, that though there would be more cases, the goal was to build a more efficient public health infrastructure. According to Ihekweazu, “What we are trying to achieve, and it’s very important for Nigerians to understand, is a landscape where we can continue our work in responding, while we restart parts of the economy. “We are responding to something, at the moment, across 22 states. But it will grow to almost every state in Nigeria. There is no reason it won’t. It is a respiratory virus. “So, what we are trying to achieve right now, in the short term, is not to stop transmission because we know that will be very difficult to do. No country in the world has achieved that.”
