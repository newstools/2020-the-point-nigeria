 … Says FG hasn’t authorised deduction from N20,000 cash transfers The Independent Corrupt Practices and other Related Offences Commission has urged Nigerians to report any form of corrupt practices in the Federal Government’s distribution of COVID-19 palliatives, especially the conditional cash transfers. The conditional cash transfer of N20,000 to citizens is part of efforts to reduce the effect of the Covid-19 lockdown on vulnerable Nigerians. While making this call on Tuesday, the ICPC said reported cases would be investigated and prosecuted, adding that the National Social Investment Programme and the Federal Ministry of Humanitarian Affairs and Disaster Management had not authorised any deduction from the cash transfer. The Minister of Humanitarian Affairs, Disaster Management and Social Development, Sadiya Farouq, had launched the Covid-19 relief distribution, including conditional cash transfers to the poor and vulnerable, saying that some states had already benefitted. The anti-graft agency said, “ICPC calls on the general public to report any form of corrupt practices in the ongoing distribution of palliatives for the COVID 19, especially the conditional cash transfers. “Note that the National Social Investment Programme and Federal Ministry of Humanitarian Affairs and Disaster Management and Social Development have not authorised any form of deductions in the conditional cash transfer. “Alleged infractions in the implementation of the COVID-19 intervention will be investigated and prosecuted where necessary. “Report all corrupt acts to ICPC on this Toll -free line: 0800 – 2255 – 4272 or email  info@icpc.gov.ng.”
