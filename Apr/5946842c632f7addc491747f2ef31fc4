The African Union Economic, Social and Cultural Council, Nigeria office, has appealed to China, France, Japan and India to write off Nigeria’s debt or allow a two-year moratorium on repayments. The Council also commended the International Monetary Fund for granting relief to 25 nations under its Catastrophe Containment and Relief Trust to tackle the novel coronavirus. AU agency’s Nigeria Representative, Oba Olasunkanmi, in a statement in Abuja on Thursday, noted that as major lenders, the four countries should also grant a reprieve to the Federal Government to contain the COVID-19 pandemic. “Certainly, this will further assist the benefiting countries to significantly cushion the impact of the dreaded disease on their economies. Nigeria, at this time, needs support to enable it recover from the financial impact,” it said. The AU further noted that it would be difficult for Nigeria to service the debts in the face of the economic realities imposed by COVID-19 “as the United Nations had projected that the world would need $1 trillion for continual existence.” The Council said, “Nigeria needs China’s support at this trying time, with the long and fruitful bilateral relationship between both countries which has led to Nigerian government owing China the debt of about $3.2 billion. “We are being faithful in payment of service charges. In 2019, Nigeria paid $138.8 million (N53.7billion) to EXIM Bank of China in settlement, the highest amount paid to any bilateral institution for the year.”
