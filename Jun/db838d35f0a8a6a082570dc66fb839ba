Police in the Agege area of Lagos have arrested an 80-year-old, Ebenezer Oyewole, for defiling a nine-year-old girl. Oyewole, who is the landlord of the house, where the victim lives with her mother, was said to have been having carnal knowledge of the minor since she was two years old. A resident of the house at 29, Aranseolu Street, Orile Agege, Powerline Bus stop, who simply indentified himself as Mr. John, told our correspondent that Pa Oyewole was an unrepentant sinner, notorious in the area for sexually abusing children. “The man is nothing but evil. He is known for the act in the area. He is a shameless man; he carries out his evil act with so much impunity. I even suspect him using the children for ritual,” he said. A Child Rights Activist, Toyin Ndidi, said, “A biological daughter of the suspect complained that she couldn’t keep quiet anymore because the man had been abusing a particular girl from the age of two, she’s now nine years old; and pa Oyewole is hell bent to continue the abuse.” “Meanwhile, it was learnt that the survivor’s mother, who was aware of the matter, was afraid to speak out, owing to fear.”
