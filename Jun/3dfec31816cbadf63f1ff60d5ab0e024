Former Commissioner for Information in Edo State, Prince Kassim Afegbua, has said that the Peoples Democratic Party in Edo State is waiting in the wings to benefit from the crisis rocking the state chapter of the All Progressives Congress. Afegbua said the people of Edo State were tired of the problems of the APC, saying they were desirous of the peace, which the PDP was ready to give them. “Our party is waiting in the wings to benefit from the crisis rocking the APC. They are creating tension in the state, but the PDP will take over and bring peace to the state,” Afegbua said. He said the PDP would soon conduct its indirect primary, promising that the party would come out stronger. “We are ready for our primary and we will have a peaceful and successful primary. The current in-fight in the APC will be to our advantage. We are going to win the election and bring a new lease of life to the Edo people,” he said. On the Executive Order limiting the number of people that can gather in the state to 50 by Governor Obaseki , Afegbua said it was wrong for Obaseki who is an active participant in the coming primaries to be setting laws that would guide the primaries.
