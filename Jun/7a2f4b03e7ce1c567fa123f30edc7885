The governorship candidate of the Action Democratic Party,  in the last gubernatorial election in Osun State, Alhaji Moshood Adeoti, has returned to the All Progressives Congress. Adeoti, who was the Secretary to the State Government, until his resignation to contest the governorship election in 2018, announced his return to the APC, on Friday, while addressing a press conference in Osogbo. He returned to APC with some members of the ADP and also directed all his supporters who had left APC with him, to return. He described his defection from the APC as a loss to the party, saying that APC would have won the election convincingly if he had remained in the party. The former SSG added that his country home became a Mecca for some APC national and state leaders after the party almost lost to the Peoples Democratic Party in 2018 and begged him to return. He emphasised that APC had become a home for him and that he suffered to the extent of being imprisoned three times for the sake of the ruling party. Adeoti, who was once the state Chairman of the Alliance for Democracy and Action Congress of Nigeria, said he had now left his gubernatorial ambition to God. “We made history in a way, in view of the number of votes, 49,742, garnered,
despite having barely less than two months to prepare for an election of such
magnitude. No candidate in the political history of the state has ever neared that
feat, given that hard choice we made and the environment we operated in,” he said. Asked whether the justice he sought for had been addressed in the APC, Adeoti said some leaders of the party had promised to ensure justice, saying, “We have been assured by the party leadership at the national and state levels that none of us would be reprimanded or discriminated against based on our past
political efforts.”
