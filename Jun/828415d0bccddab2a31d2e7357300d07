President Muhammadu Buhari, for the first time in over two months, attended a Ju’mat prayer at the State House Mosque, on Friday, in line with the new guidelines on religious gatherings. The Presidential Task Force on COVID-19 okayed the reopening of churches and mosques, on Monday, but restricted service to Sundays and Fridays, respectively. “For churches, each service should be for a maximum of an hour with an interval of 30 minutes in between services to allow time for disinfection. Mosques may open 15 minutes before and 10 minutes after prayers. The total time for Friday prayers should not exceed an hour,” PTF National Coordinator, Sani Aliyu, said. Buhari was joined at the Ju’mat prayer by senior aides, while civil servants from Grade 14 and above also participated, after routine screening. According to the reviewed guidelines, any close contact is forbidden, including shaking of hands, hugging, kissing, handing out materials, and sharing of worship implements, including prayer mats, musical organs, microphones, etc
