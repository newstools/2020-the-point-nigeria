The Osun State Government has confirmed 10 new Covid-19 cases after carrying out a contact tracing of previous cases in Osogbo and Ilesa. The Commissioner for Health in the state, Dr. Rafiu Isamotu, disclosed this on Sunday in a statement issued in Osogbo. Dispelling a rumour that there were some cases of the virus in some hospitals in the state, the government cautioned residents and citizens against spreading false information. The commissioner revealed that, with the latest development, the number of confirmed cases in the state had risen to 116, while the state now has 64 active cases. Stressing that rumour mongers goofed, the commissioner explained, “When our health workers contracted the virus, we reported it. We treated them and they are now back to their beats. To the best of my knowledge, we do not have any fresh case or cases in any of our hospitals. “All confirmed cases are being treated in the state’s isolation centres.  The only case we had in one of our hospitals was that of a patient who later died even before his result came out.” He noted, “Immediately after the incident, we decontaminated the hospital and the hospital management continued with their operations thereafter. So, I don’t know where the false information about two new cases emanated from. But wherever it came from, I say emphatically that it is false. “We must collectively join hands with the government to contain the spread of the virus. Spreading false information will not aid our fight against the spread of the virus.” “With the latest development, the number of our active cases as at today, Sunday, June 28, is 64. We have 116 confirmed cases, out of which the state has successfully treated and discharged 47 patients, while five deaths have been recorded,” he added.
