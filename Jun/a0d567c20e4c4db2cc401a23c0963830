Celebrity photographer, TY Bello, has posted a screenshot of the last WhatsApp chat she had with ex-Beauty Queen, Ibidun Ighodalo, on Instagram. Their chats were about the late Ibidun’s preparations for her 40th birthday, which would have been next month. “Sweetie, it’s my 40th next month and I want to help 40 couples to have their babies. What do you think? That’s all I want. No party, no surprise nothing. I just want to make 40 homes happy,” the late wife of Trinity House Senior Pastor, Ituah Ighodalo, said. Ibidun was married for 13 years.
