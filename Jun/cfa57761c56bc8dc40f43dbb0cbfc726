 There is anxiety in Oyo State and among the All Progressives Congress leaders over the rumoured death of a former Governor of Oyo State, Senator Abiola Ajimobi. There had been unconfirmed reports of the death of the APC Deupty National Chairman, just a few hours after he was named acting National Chairman of the party, following the Appeal Court Judgement upholding the suspension of Oshiomhole as National Chairman. Some online reports said the two time Governor of Oyo State died in the early hours of Thursday, after a brief battle with COVID-19. Ajimobi had reportedly remained positive for COVID-19 for about two weeks. However, his Media Aide, Bolaji Tunji, dispelled the rumour, urging Nigerians to continue praying for the recovery of his boss. “Ajimobi’s death cannot be hidden. As a Muslim, he must be buried within a stipulated time,” an Ibadan elder, Alhaji Hakeem Azeez, said. “They could, however, be playing politics this time because he seems to be at the centre of the APC crisis now,” he added.
