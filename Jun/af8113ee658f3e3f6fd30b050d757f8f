The President of the African Development Bank, Akinwumi Adesina is currently meeting with President Muhammadu Buhari at the Presidential Villa, Abuja. The meeting may not be unconnected with the controversy over the reopening of an investigation into allegations of misconduct against the AfDB President. Adesina had repeatedly cleared his name and insisted on his innocence with respect to the allegations. Just on Tuesday, members of the House of Representatives urged the board of the African Development Bank to disregard a call for a probe. The call followed a motion moved by the Minority Leader Ndudi Elumelu, titled, “Attempts to Tarnish the Image and Hard-Earned Reputation of Dr Akinwumi Adesina, President of the African Development Bank on Trumped-Up Allegations.” Elumelu recalled that former African leaders, led by former President Olusegun Obasanjo, had issued a press statement, pointing out the grave danger inherent in disregarding the laws governing an institution such as the AfDB. He said, “The House is concerned that recently, a group of whistleblowers petitioned Dr Adesina, accusing him of 16 breaches of the bank’s code of conduct, some of which include private gains, impediments to efficiency, preferential treatment and involvement in political activities, which Adesina has continued to deny. “The House is further concerned that after an investigation by the ethics committee of the board of directors, the allegations were found to be frivolous, unsubstantiated, lacking in merit and, therefore, exonerated Adesina on all 16 allegations.”
