ADELEKE ADESANYA The police in Ogun have arrested three suspected hackers who specialised in breaking into people’s bank accounts. According to a reliable source, the suspects are: Adebayo Oluwatosin, 23; Obinna Abiogbe, 27 and Segun Adefunmi. The suspects were arrested for hacking into the bank account of one Kolawole Sobande and siphoning the sum of N300, 000. The arrest of the suspects followed a piece of information received from a P.O.S operator, who alerted the police that one of the suspects approached him to transfer the sum of N100,000 from an account to his own (POS operator’s) and hand it over to him. But when he demanded his identity card, he discovered that it bore different names from the one on the bank account. Upon receiving the information, the DPO Sango Division, CSP Godwin Idehia, detailed detectives to the scene, where the suspects were arrested. The account owner was contacted and he confirmed that the sum of N300,000 had been withdrawn from his account. On interrogation, the suspects confessed being internet fraudsters, who specialised in hacking into people’s bank account and siphoning their money. Meanwhile, the state’s Commissioner of Police, Kenneth Ebrimson, has ordered a full-scale investigation into the past activities of the suspects with a view to arraign them before a court of competence jurisdiction.
