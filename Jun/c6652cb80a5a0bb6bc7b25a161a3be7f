The Police in Lagos have arrested a 400 Level student of the Lagos State University, Adeyeye Oluwatosin Babatunde, for engaging in a passionate kiss with his three-year-old step sister. A viral video captured Babatunde, a Botany student, who resides at Kajola Street, Shagamu, Ogun State, engaging in a passionate kiss with the toddler at their residence. The video was released on social media on June 2, 2020. Spokesman of the Lagos State Police Command, Bala Elkana, said, in a statement on Friday, that the Lagos Commissioner of Police, Hakeem Odumosu, had tasked detectives from the Gender Unit to analyse the video and apprehend the suspect. The team, Elkana said, arrested the suspect on June 5, 2020 at about 11am, adding that he had been handed to the State Criminal Investigation Department, Yaba, for prosecution. Babatunde, who regretted his action, however, said their father and other people were there when he kissed his step sister, and that it was not the first time he would do so. He said he recorded the video himself and posted it on his whatsapp status because he did it innocently. He added that one of his contacts made the video go viral. The CP expressed his gratitude to Nigerians who helped in bringing the incident to the notice of the Police and urged everyone to continue to speak out against sexual and gender-based violence. “Together we can stop rape, stop child abuse and crime against our women and children,” he said.
