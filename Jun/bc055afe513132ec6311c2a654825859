… says ‘everybody will die’ The widow of Senator Abiola Ajimobi, former Governor of Oyo State, Florence, has faulted members of the Oyo State Government for not identifying with the family when her husband was on his sick bed and even after he died. She said in a video that has gone viral that even after the demise of her husband, the least she expected was for those she was addressing to send words of encouragement to her. “Everybody is going to die. My husband is dead, he served this state for eight good years,” she said. Ajimobi died on Thursday at a Lagos hospital as a result of COVID-19 complications.
