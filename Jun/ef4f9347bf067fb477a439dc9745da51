The Federal Government is considering a fresh lockdown of 18 Local Government Areas where 60 per cent of confirmed COVID-19 cases in Nigeria have been recorded. This may form part of guidelines for the next phase of decisions on the containment of the COVID-19 pandemic in the country. The Chairman of the Presidential Task Force on COVID-19, Boss Mustapha, who spoke to State House correspondents after the PTF briefed President Muhammadu Buhari, on Monday, described the new lockdown strategy as “precision lockdown.” According to him, 80 per cent of confirmed COVID-19 infections in Nigeria are in the age bracket of 31 to 40 years. This, he said, was a very active part of the Nigerian population. National Centre for Disease Control’s statistics reveal that 11 out of the 20 local government areas that account for 60 per cent of infections are in Lagos. Some of the councils listed are Abuja Municipal Area Council, Mushin Local Government Area, Lagos;  Eti-Osa Local Government Area, Lagos; and Tarauni Local Government Area in Kano State, among others.
