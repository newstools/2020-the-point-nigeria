House of Reps rejects castration as punishment for rapists The House of Representatives has voted against a motion seeking castration as punishment for rapists. James Faleke, representing Ikeja Federal Constituency moved the motion that persons found guilty of rape should be castrated, but the House rejected it but called for other stiffer penalties. Falekeâ€™s motion generated a heated debate, which lasted for almost two hours. The Speaker of the House, Femi Gbajabiamila, asked the legislators to ponder on what would happen when an older female raped a younger male, before voting. The majority voted against it. Members, however, resolved to dress in black next Tuesday, in honour of victims of sexual violence in Nigeria. Nigerians had expressed outrage over the rape and murder of a 23-year-old 100-level female Microbiology student of the University of Benin, Vera Omozuwa, inside a church in Edo State where she reportedly went to study on May 13. She died 18 days later at the University of Benin Teaching Hospital, the police said.
