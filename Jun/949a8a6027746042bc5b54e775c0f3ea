The National Agency for the Prohibition of Trafficking in Persons has urged Nigerians to report cases of rape within their vicinity to the agency or the nearest police station. It said the names and photos of sex offenders in the country would soon be published. NAPTIP Director-General, Julie Okah-Donli, made this known on Thursday in Abuja, following the rising cases of rape in the country. According to her, reporting cases of rape is the only way to curtail the abominable act, adding that the agency will act on reported cases. She said, “Rapists are now getting away with their illicit acts along with murder; these cases of domestic servitude are cases that take place behind closed doors. “Our job in NAPTIP is to protect Nigerian men and women, we are not going to compromise our work if they report such cases and we will ensure justice is done. “Rape cases are not reported because of stigmatisation of the victims and this makes the cases rise. And very soon, the names of rapists will be published with their pictures in the media.” Okah-Donli said the Sex Offenders’ Register had already been opened in the agency where the names of rape perpetrators were documented for further actions. – NAN
