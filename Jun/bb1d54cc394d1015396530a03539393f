Men of the Amotekun Corps in Osun State, on Tuesday, intercepted some northern youths while trying to move into the state with weapons and assorted charms. The northerners who boarded buses claimed they were labourers at mining sites in the state. They were seen with machetes, cutlasses, shovels and assorted charms. While on interrogation, they could not explain why they came with weapons and assorted charms and were trying to enter into the state when the interstate travel ban was still in force. The drivers of the commuter buses also claimed that they were only conveying the travelers from Ibadan, Oyo State capital, to Osogbo, in Osun after they had alighted from trucks coming from the North. The men of Amotekun corps, after denying them entry into Osun, sent them back to where they were coming from in order to prevent importation of COVID-19 in the state.
