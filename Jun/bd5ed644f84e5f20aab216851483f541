Members of the Civil Society Network Against Corruption staged a peaceful protest at the Economic and Financial Crimes Commission office in Lagos, on Tuesday.  The protesters, carrying various placards calling for an investigation into what they described as “Obasagate”, also submitted a petition against the Speaker of the Lagos State House of Assembly, Mudashiru Obasa, to the Head of EFCC in Lagos, Mohammed Rabo.  The Coordinator of CISNAC, Shina Odugbemi, said, “Our mission here this morning is to present you a letter about an issue in Lagos State. Everywhere is awashed with the accusation that the Speaker of the House of Assembly is squandering money. We pick issues and we ensure that we follow issues to logical conclusions. This is one of the steps.  “We have come here today to present to you our petition that contains a catalogue of allegations. The truth is that these allegations, until they are investigated and until a court of competent jurisdiction rules over them, we can’t say somebody is a thief or not.”  The group alleged that there was a conspiracy to sweep the allegations under the carpet, which they were against.  The Head of the anti-graft agency in Lagos, however, promised the protesters that the petition would be given the required attention, noting that allegations do not confirm that the accused is guilty.  “I have received your petition and in our usual way, we don’t segregate if there is any allegation. But like you rightly said an allegation does not confirm the guilt of a person until investigations are well established. I want to assure you that like every other petition we receive, we will give it the required attention,” he said.
