Iran’s government has issued an arrest warrant for United States President Donald Trump over the killing of its top commander, Qasem Soleimani, in January, the country’s semi-official Fars news agency reported on Monday. Tehran is also reportedly asking Interpol for help, according to Fars. Trump, however, is in no danger to be arrested, according to the Associated Press. Soleimani led Iran’s Quds Force, the foreign operations wing of the elite paramilitary Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps. The Trump administration labeled him a terrorist, and Washington deemed him responsible for the deaths of hundreds of US troops in Iraq. The 62-year-old Soleimani was killed in a drone strike directed by Trump in early January while in the Iraqi capital of Baghdad, in a move that sent regional tensions and oil prices surging and set off a retaliatory attack by Iran and its proxies on Iraqi bases housing US troops. The Trump administration has so far not responded to Iran’s announcement. – CNBC
