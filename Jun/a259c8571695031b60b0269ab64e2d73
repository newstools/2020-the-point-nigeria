The Police in Ogun State have arrested a couple, Osas and Tomisin Onyeokweni, for allegedly stripping Osas’ ex-lover naked and inserting an empty bottle into her private part. The couple reportedly lured the 20-year-old victim into an uncompleted building after which Tomisin (wife), who was armed with a pair of scissors, tore the victim’s dress and left her naked. The Police Public Relations Officer in the state, Abimbola Oyeyemi, who disclosed this in a statement on Monday, said the victim was lured into an uncompleted building before the couple perpetrated the act. He said, “The couple was arrested following a complaint by the victim who reported at Agbara divisional headquarters that her former boyfriend Osas Onyeokweni who is now married to her friend Tomisin Onyeokweni called her on phone to meet him somewhere around Lusada area for an important discussion. “She further stated that on getting to the agreed place, she met Osas and his wife and they both lured her into an uncompleted apartment where Osas’ wife who was armed with scissors used the scissors to tear her dress and stripped her naked.” He added that after she had been stripped naked, Osas held her down while his wife inserted an empty bottle of alomo bitters into her private part. “They also snapped her naked picture and threatened to upload it on the internet if she dares report to anyone,” he added. The couple was arrested after the Divisional Police Officer at Agbara, SP Dahiru Saleh, dispatched his detectives to go after them. “On interrogation, the couple admitted to committing the crime but pleaded that they regretted their action,” the PPRO said, adding that the Commissioner of Police, Kenneth Ebrimson, had directed that the suspects be charged to court as soon as investigation is concluded.
