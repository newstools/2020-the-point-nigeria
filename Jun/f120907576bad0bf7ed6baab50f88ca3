… says ‘My integrity matters’ Governor Nyesom Wike of Rivers State, on Tuesday, said he had pulled out of the reconciliation of the Edo State Chapter of the Peoples Democratic Party. In a  statement signed by the Commissioner for Information and Communications, Paulinus Nsirim, Wike alleged that some members of the PDP National Working Committee were sycophants and tax collectors who would never tell the truth. The governor said he had advised on the need to handle the current situation in Edo State carefully, indicating that he had been wrongly accused of being responsible for the order obtained from a Federal High Court in Abuja. “I told them that in Edo State, we must handle the issue carefully and carry everybody along. They must respect human beings and not behave like tax collectors,” he claimed. Wike added, “They said because an order was obtained from a Federal High Court in Port Harcourt, then I am responsible. I have had sleepless nights to resolve the issue in Edo State. The Governors of Edo, Adamawa, and Delta states, know what I have done to resolve the issues in Edo. “As a result of this senseless accusation, I have pulled out of Edo State settlement. My integrity matters.”
