  Former Governor of Ogun State and Senator representing Ogun Central Senatorial District, Senator Ibikunle Amosun, has commiserated with the family of Senator Abiola Ajimobi who passed away on Thursday, 25th June, 2020. In a letter addressed to the wife of Senator Ajimobi, Mrs. Florence Ajimobi, Amosun described the late Ajimobi as a highly skilled and educated professional, who had a successful career in the private sector, culminating in his appointment as the Chief Executive of National Oil Corporation of Nigeria. A statement signed by Amosun’s media aide, Bola Adeyemi, quoted the former governor as saying that Ajimobi distinguished himself in the service of Oyo State where he made history as the first to be elected Governor twice just as in the Senate where he served as a principal officer in the fifth Senate. Amosun described Senator Ajimobi as a “good friend and brother, who would be remembered for his hard work, sense of humour and diligence in the service of humanity.” He prayed that God would grant Ajimobi’s family the fortitude to bear the irreparable loss. He also prayed that Allah grants him Aljannat Firdaous.
