… Flags off 50,000 pieces fish farm in Abeokuta Former President Olusegun Obasanjo has warned against a post Convid-19 food crisis in Africa, urging governments in the continent to rise to the challenge. He spoke at his Olusegun Obasanjo Presidential Library OOPL lake pond, Abeokuta, Ogun State, where he flagged off a fish farming project, at the weekend. A statement released by the former President’s media aide, Kehinde Akinyemi, on Monday, confirmed that about 50,000 pieces of sub-adult fish in both Catfish and Tilapia species were released for acclamatisation and subsequent growth inside the lake pond, located directly opposite the main Library. Obasanjo who was visibly elated by the new farm said the idea came from his thinking out of the box, “as what is next after the novel pandemic Coronavirus in the world, will be food crisis in Africa.” He said, “I think we have to take the issue of post Covid-19 seriously. I believe most African governments have to find how to be self-sufficient in essential food items for the food crisis likely to be experienced not to be a waste. Because food might be a problem and I dont think most African countries have gone as far as they should go into food production during this year. “I want to advise African governments to embark on massive food production as part of measures to prepare for the post Convid-19 pandemic era in Africa. There may be food problem in the continent after the Covid-19 pandemic. We must think out of the box to get this solved now. Food must be made available.” Speaking more on the fish farm project, Aquaculture consultant, Steve Okeleji, said the initial process of the stocking was to allow for acclimatization before finally releasing them to the lake. While commercial activities are expected in four months time at the lake, visitors as well can seize the opportunity to spend part of their tour periods around the lake to feed the fishes.
