The Nigerian Bar Association has kicked against what it described as misrepresentation of lawyers by popular social media comedian, Lasisi Elenu, especially as regards his latest video. The NBA cautioned the comedian in a subtle manner, saying if he must crack jokes about lawyers, he must represent them properly by appearing the right way in the wig and gown. Lasisi Elenu, who enjoys a large base of following on social media, and depicts various characters in his videos, recently delved into the world of lawyers. He presents a court proceeding with humour and his own kind of constitution. Reacting, the Assistant National Publicity Secretary of the NBA, Habeeb Lawal, said, “We beg to use you as a point of reference to all other comedians. Lawyers have awesome sense of humour, as such we enjoy your jokes and appreciate the creativity. “However, if you must represent our profession in your works kindly ensure you properly adorn the wig, bip and gown. “We acknowledge your right of expression, but note that we also reserve the rights to take all necessary steps to guide against the ridicule of our noble profession and @NigBarAssoc shall not hesitate to exercise those rights.”
