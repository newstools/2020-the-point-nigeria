Governor Rotimi Akeredolu of Ondo State, on Tuesday, informed Nigerians that he had tested positive for coronavirus. Akeredolu disclosed this via his Twitter handle. “Today, I tested positive for #COVID19. All is well. I’m asymptomatic and have been self-isolating. Work continues. Your continued prayers over my well being are most appreciated,” he tweeted. Akeredolu explained, in a video attached to his tweet, that he took the COVID-19 test after being treated for malaria. He said, “My good people of Ondo State. It gives me great pleasure to address you at this moment. I had malaria two days ago and was treated. I did get over it. “At the APC NEC meeting, one of my colleagues spoke with me. He advised that malaria should not be just treated as likely. That I should go ahead and have a test for COVID-19.” The governor added, “The result came out today, June 30, 2020, and I tested positive. But I am asymptomatic. I am not feeling sick nor feeling odd in any way. “But my doctor has said that I should take the necessary steps and self-isolate. I believe that supervised home management would be ideal for me for now.” Akeredolu and his deputy, Agboola Ajayi, have been at loggerheads for a few weeks over the latter’s defection to the opposition Peoples Democratic Party. Ajayi had raised the alarm that the governor was planning to impeach him, insisting that he would not resign his position as deputy governor.
