 The remains of the late Acting Chairman of the All Progressives Congress, Abiola Ajimobi, have been laid to rest, according to Islamic rites, on Sunday. Ajimobi, the immediate past Governor of Oyo State, was buried at his residence in Yemoja Street, Oluyole Estate, Ibadan. Our correspondent, who got to the venue of the burial as early as 8am, could not gain entrance, owing to the very tight security there, as fierce looking armed police officers were positioned for maximum security. The state government, in a statement released by the Chief Press Secretary to Governor Seyi Makinde, Taiwo Adisa, on Saturday, had explained that the familyâ€™s choice of Agodi GRA for the burial was not approved, owing to litigation on the said property. Ajimobi, who died on Thursday at a Lagos hospital, was buried at about 10am. As a Muslim, he should have been buried earlier, usually within 24 hours. But there could be exceptions to the rule, depending on the circumstances surrounding the death, Islamic scholars have said.  Less than 20 people, including the wife of the late Governor, Mrs. Florence Ajimobi, other members of his immediate family and a few close relatives were in attendance. The burial, as observed, was in strict compliance with COVID-19 guidelines as many party loyalists, and even some extended family members were barred from attending.
