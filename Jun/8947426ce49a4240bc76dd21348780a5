The royal family of the Enogie of Oka Numoogunhen, Ikpoba Okha Local Government Area of Edo State, has appealed to His Royal Majesty, Omo N’Oba, Uku Akpolokpo, Oba Ewuare II, to stop the burial of the family’s first son, slated for this Friday. A press statement by the present first son of the family, Prince Oscar Osayoige Edoigiawerie, said that their late first son allegedly exhumed their late father’s body, which he said was peacefully buried in his (late father) compound, to an unknown place without the consent of the other children. According to him, this act of burying their first son, who allegedly exhumed their father’s body without their consent, is an abomination in Benin tradition. He, therefore, pleaded that His Royal Majesty should not allow the burial to take place without the necessary sacrifice, just as he added that this abominable act had mysteriously claimed the lives of other promising five sons. He said, “We the entire children of our late father, are demanding for justice to know where a father of 37 children will be exhumed from his final resting peace after selling the whole house. We want to know where our late father’s body was relocated or even where his bones are kept.” “We are very scared, and we want to put a stop to this endless sudden death that has been tormenting us all these years so we can all be free. It’s a very serious abomination against our tradition/culture, as we don’t know who will be next to fall down again as three gallant and very young men in their prime have died mysteriously. Five (5) men from the children his mother had for our late father.”
