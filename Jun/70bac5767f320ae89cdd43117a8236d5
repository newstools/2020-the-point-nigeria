THE Inspector-General of Police, Mohammed Adamu, has ordered Ondo State Commissioner of Police, Bolaji Salami, to restore the security details of the Deputy Governor of the state, Agboola Ajayi, with immediate effect. The IGP’s directive was contained in a memo addressed to the police commissioner through the Deputy Inspector General of Police, Operations, Force Headquarters Abuja on Monday. The News Agency of Nigeria reports that men of the Nigeria Police attached to the deputy governor were withdrawn after he had defected to the Peoples Democratic Party from the ruling All Progressives Congress. Ajayi had, last Wednesday, cried out that his life was in danger when policemen attached to his office were withdrawn on the orders of the Commissioner of Police in the state. The memo with Ref. No CB: 2002/DOPS/FHQ/ABJ/VOL/77/168 was signed on behalf of the IGP by Austine Agbonlahor, Assistant Inspector-General of Police. The deputy governor, who accused the Commissioner of Police of working on the instructions of Governor Oluwarotimi Akeredolu to withdraw the officers, had for a while, been having a running battle with him. Ajayi had engaged in a confrontation with the police at the Government House, following the alleged refusal of the latter to allow him to leave the premises allegedly on the orders of the governor. Meanwhile, the deputy governor had in a statement released by his Media Aide, Mr Babatope Okeowo, lauded “the integrity and courage displayed by the majority of the lawmakers for shunning all entreaties, inducement, and intimidation to impeach him.” The statement also urged lawmakers to also shun another latest plan to move the next meeting of the impeachment plot to a private hotel in Akure. – NAN
