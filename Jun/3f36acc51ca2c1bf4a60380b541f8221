… Gives parties 3hrs for out-of-court settlement A Federal High Court in Port Harcourt has granted a three-hour stand down, in the suit instituted to bar Governor Godwin Obaseki from participating in the Peoples Democratic Party’s governorship primary in Edo State. The three-hour stand down was granted for parties to reach an amicable out-of-court settlement, following an oral application by the plaintiff’s lawyer, Mr Ferdinand Orbih (SAN). Counsel to the respondents Emmanuel Enoidem, Higher King, Alex Ejesiema, and M. E. Ani, agreed to the stand down prayer for the parties two discuss. Justice E.O. Obile of the Federal High Court ordered the parties to discuss and document their terms of settlement within three hours. The case, he said, would be recalled at 12.30pm on Wednesday for the parties to brief the court on the outcome of their discussion. One of the PDP aspirants in the state, Omoregie Ogbeide-Ihama, had instituted the suit that sought to bar Obaseki from contesting in the Edo PDP primary, praying that only those who purchased the forms within the stipulated window should be allowed to contest, among others.
