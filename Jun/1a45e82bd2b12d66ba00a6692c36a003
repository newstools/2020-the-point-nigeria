Former governor of Ekiti State, Ayodele Fayose, has said that democracy is currently non-existent in Nigeria, but will return after President Muhammadu Buhari’s tenure. As a result of this, he noted that there was no reason to celebrate on the occasion of this year’s Democracy Day. He spoke in a statement by his media aide, Lere Olayinka, on the occasion of the June 12 2020 Democracy Day celebration. He said, “Today,  there is no democracy to celebrate and I have not stopped wondering how we got here in Nigeria. “It was painful that the legacy of free, fair and transparent elections bequeathed to Nigeria by the PDP government has been destroyed with elections in the country now being held at gunpoint.” He faulted what he described as an open display of contempt for free, fair and transparent election by the ruling party, adding that peace and prosperity could only be achieved when leaders earned legitimacy through the ballot. “Democracy will return to Nigeria again after President Buhari’s tenure. I am sure Nigerians will still recall that I warned them in 2015. The people mourn when the wicked are in authority while they rejoice when the righteous are in leadership. Today, Nigerians are mourning,” Fayose declared.
