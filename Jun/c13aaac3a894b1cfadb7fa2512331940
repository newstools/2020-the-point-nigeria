Tragedy struck at Ring Road, Benin City, on Friday, when a moving vehicle crushed an enforcement officer to death. The victim, identified as Tony, who is believed to be a member of the Edo State Public Works Volunteer (PUWOV), was trying to arrest a traffic violator when the incident occurred. It was gathered that on seeing a commercial bus picking up passengers at an unauthorised portion of the Ring Road, Tony, in a bid to catch the offender, ran to the middle of the road, held the door to jump in, but the conductor pushed him down. Further investigation revealed that Tony fell down flat on the road where an oncoming car rammed across his head, leaving him dead. The development, which drew a large crowd of sympathisers, caused heavy traffic on the road. Efforts to get comments from the Chairman of the PUWOV, Murktari Osagie, was unsuccessful.
