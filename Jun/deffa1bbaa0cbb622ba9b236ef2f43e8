The Deputy National Secretary of the All Progressives Congress, Victor Giadom, has announced himself as the Acting National Chairman of the party. He made the announcement during a media briefing at the party’s National Secretariat. He said his pronouncement followed a meeting of the National Working Committee after Tuesday’s Appeal Court ruling upholding the suspension of the National Chairman, Adams Oshiomhole. He said, “Yesterday (Tuesday) the Court of Appeal sitting in Abuja, in a unanimous judgment, affirmed the suspension of Comrade Adams Oshiomhole as National Chairman of All Progressives Congress. “Consequently, I bring to your notice that on the 16th of March 2020, Hon Justice S.U Bature in suit no FCT/HC/M/6447/2020 had ordered that, with the earlier suspension of Comrade Adams Oshiomhole, I, Chief Hon. Victor Giadom should act as the National Chairman of our great party. “That Order could not be immediately effected at the time because of the temporary reprieve Adams Oshiomhole got from the court of Appeal on the same date.” He added, “As your Acting National Chairman and presiding officer in the NWC, we therefore cancel the decision of the Screening and Appeal Committees of the former Chairman of the party on the Edo primary.” The National Publicity Secretary of the party, Lanre Issa-Onilu, had issued a statement, earlier, announcing the Deputy National Chairman (South), Senator Abiola Ajimobi, as Acting National Chairman.
