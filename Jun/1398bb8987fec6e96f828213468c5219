The wife of the President, Aisha Buhari, on Friday, called on the Inspector-General of Police, Mohammed Adamu, to release her aides, who, she said, were in the custody of the Police for an offence she did not mention. The President’s wife made the appeal in a series of tweets. Mrs. Buhari’s aides were reportedly detained on the orders of the Chief Security Officer (CSO) to the President, Idris Kassim. A report by Sahara Reporters had said that one of the President’s top aides, Yusuf Sabiu, popularly called Tunde, forced his way into the Presidential Villa after returning from another state recently, without self-isolating. Following this, Sabiu was said to have been forcibly evicted from the Villa by Mrs. Buhari’s aides. In turn, he allegedly arranged the arrest of the First Lady’s aides, including her ADC, Usman Shugaba, through the CSO. Perhaps not wanting to be too direct like in the past, Mrs. Buhari tweeted, “That Covid-19 is real and still very much around in our nation is not in doubt. Consequently, I call on all relevant government agencies to enforce the Quarantine Act signed by Mr. President and ensure no one is found violating this law and the NCDC guidelines especially on interstate travel without the necessary exemptions for movement of essentials.” “Anyone who does that should at the very least be made to undergo a-14 day mandatory isolation no matter who the person is, no one should be above the law and the Police command will do well to remember that,” she added, apparently referring to the President’s aide. “Finally, I call on the IGP to release my assigned staff who are still in the custody of the police in order to avoid putting their lives in danger or exposure to Covid-19 while in their custody,” she said.
