The Osun State Government, on Thursday, confirmed the discovery of 17 new COVID-19 cases in the state. This was disclosed as the state government warned residents to desist from being lackadaisical towards prevent measures, saying “the virus is still very much with us.” The Commissioner for Health in the state, Dr. Rafiu Isamotu, made this known through a press statement in Osogbo. He said three of the previous cases had been discharged after testing negative for the virus. According to him, six new cases were discovered on Wednesday night after the discovery of seven cases earlier, while 11 others were discovered on Thursday. All the cases had been taken into the state’s Isolation and Treatment Centres in Osogbo and Ile Ife, he said. Isamotu further revealed that two of the cases came from Redeemer’s University in Ede, and that, as of press time, their travel history had yet to be ascertained. He also hinted that while some of the latest cases clearly had contacts with previous cases in the state, the surveillance team was still working on ascertaining where others contracted the virus from. Warning citizens and residents of the state to take responsibility by not letting down their guards, Isamotu said “we (Osun people) are already appearing to be putting up lackadaisical attitude.” He noted, “The virus is still very much with us. We must observe precautionary measures if we must avoid community transmission.  We must, in addition to all other precautionary measures, use our face masks always. We must also put an end to travelling up and down. The ban on inter-state travel is still in force. “With the latest development, the number of our active cases as at today, Thursday, June 25, is 32. We have 84 confirmed cases, out of which the State has successfully treated and discharged 47 patients. while five deaths have been recorded.”
