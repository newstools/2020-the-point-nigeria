…Decision on schools’ reopening to be taken in 2 weeks Governor Babajide Sanwo-Olu of Lagos State has said that worship centres will reopen in the state from June 19. The Governor, who spoke at a press briefing on Thursday, said mosques would reopen June 19, and churches, June 21. He, however, said the decision to reopen schools in the state would be taken in two weeks, after an extensive meeting with stakeholders in the education sector. “I know we are all eager to know the plans we have for the reopening of our learning institutions. There is still a lot more work to be done in this regard and we are looking at the educational sector very differently,” he said. According to him, online learning will continue in seven higher institutions. Sanwo-Olu said, “On primary and secondary schools, we will be engaging with the Ministry of Education and Lagos State Safety Commission, and we will be coming out with a full and specific pronouncement in two weeks’ time. “Once the protocols have been agreed with the stakeholders, as to when and how, the schools will be reopening.” He added that manufacturing companies would be allowed to operate between 7am and 6pm.
