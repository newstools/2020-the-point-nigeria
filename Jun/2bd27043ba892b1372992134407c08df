COVID-19: Gov Okowa, wife embark on isolation as daughter tests positive There is palpable fear in Delta State Government House, as Governor Ifeanyi Okowa and his family embark on self-isolation after one of his daughters tested positive for COVID-19. The governor disclosed his daughter’s COVID-19 status on his verified Twitter handle. She was one of the 106 positive cases in the state, announced by the Nigeria Centre for Disease Control yesterday. “Earlier today, Edith and I received the news that one of our daughters has tested positive for COVID-19. Hence, in-line with the laid out procedures, we are both going into isolation for the next 14-days. We will continue to keep you all updated,” Okowa tweeted.
