The planned arraignment of a former Attorney General of the Federation, Mohammed Adoke (SAN), and his co-defendants accused of fraud in the controversial Malabu Oil, deal could not hold on Wednesday. The arraignment, scheduled for the Gwagwalada Division of the High Court of the Federal Capital Territory, Abuja, was stalled, owing to the failure of the Economic and Financial Crimes Commission (EFCC) to serve the defendants ahead of proceedings. The EFCC counsel, Bala Sanga, told the court that the commission had only served the charges on the fifth to the seventh defendants: Nigeria Agip Exploration, Shell Nigeria Ultra Deep Limited, and Shell Nigeria Exploration Production Company Limited. The second defendant, Aliyu Abubakar, had not been served because he was on the run and was only arrested on Wednesday morning, he said. He indicated that the EFCC wanted to ensure that Aliyu was arrested and served before others, adding that he was surprised that the defence lawyers were in court. Only the fourth defendant, Malabu Oil and Gas Limited, out of seven, was not represented by a lawyer. One of the officials of the firm, however, told the court that the firm had not been served. Chief Wole Olanipekun (SAN), representing Aliyu, kicked against the prosecution’s claim that his client was on the run. Meanwhile, Adoke’s lawyers – Paul Erokoro (SAN) and Mike Ozekhome (SAN) – observed that despite the fact that their client had been in EFCC custody since December 19, 2020, the agency had refused to serve him the charges of 42 counts. The defendants’ counsel, in spite of not being served yet, told the court that they were willing to waive that to allow the arraignment to take place. But Justice Idris Kutigi maintained that the trial could not proceed when the fourth defendant not represented by a lawyer had not been served. He adjourned the hearing till Thursday.
