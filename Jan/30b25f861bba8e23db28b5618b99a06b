 The Federal Government and governors of the six South-West states have reportedly reached an agreement on Operation Amotekun. Media aide to the Vice-President, Laolu Akande, disclosed this known on his verified Twitter handle on Thursday. Akande, however, did not give details of the agreement reached. He said in his tweet, “News Flash: FG, Southwest Governors agree on Amotekun.” Recall that a meeting between Osinbajo and the governors of the six South-West states held at the Presidential Villa in Abuja on Thursday. The minister of Justice, Abubakar Malami, and the Inspector-General of Police, Mohammed Adamu, also attended the meeting. Amotekun has been generated controversies. The Federal Government had declared it “illegal” in a statement from Malami’s office. The government had said it had a policy on community policing, which had been approved by the President Muhammadu Buhari, as against the regional security arrangement, which Amoteku represents. But the governors had insisted they would not dump Amotekun and decided to dialogue with the Presidency on the matter.
