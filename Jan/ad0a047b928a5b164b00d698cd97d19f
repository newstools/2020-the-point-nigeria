British lawmakers have started their final round of voting on the historic legislation that enables Britain to leave the European Union by January 31. MPs in the lower House of Commons had approved the EU Withdrawal Agreement Bill that ratifies the Brexit terms. The unelected upper House of Lords, however, made certain changes. MPs rejected amendments bearing on the rights of EU citizens, including child refugees, when the bill returned to the Commons on Wednesday, and sent it back to the Lords. Queen Elizabeth II may have to give a formal assent to the legislation by Thursday if peers agree to shelve their concerns. Conclusion on the deal will add to Prime Minister Boris Johnson’s achievements. He resumed office last year with a promise to put a stop to the unending bickering over Britain’s EU membership. Theresa May, Johnson’s predecessor, had negotiated a Brexit deal with Brussels in 2018 before her resignation. But MPs rejected it thrice. Johnson agreed on changes to the text with Brussels, but was again defeated by a parliament, which was still unable to agree on how, when or if the landmark 2016 referendum vote for Brexit should even be implemented. The last general election changed the cards, with Johnson returning to office with a large majority of MPs who supported the deal.
