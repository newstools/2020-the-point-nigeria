Commandant of the Nigeria Security and Civil Defence Corps, Imo State Command, Raji Ibrahim, said that the paramilitary organisation has set up an administrative panel to investigate its officer allegedly involved in killing of the senatorial candidate of the Action Alliance, Ndubuisi Emenike, last Sunday. The commandant, who briefed newsmen in Owerri, disclosed that the officer identified as ASC1 Syndey Ogudoro would undergo internal interrogation after the police had finished their investigation. “After the police and other agencies have concluded their investigations, and the officer released to us, we will carry out our administrative investigation, ” he said. He said that the NSCDC did not believe in accidental discharge as its officers had been trained on how to carry and handle guns. “We don’t believe in accidental discharge because we are disciplined and well tutored on how to handle guns,” he said. To this end, the commandant disclosed that NSCDC Commandant General, Abdullahi Gana Muhammadu, had ordered a full scale investigation into the alleged killing of the politician. He, however, explained that the officer was not an orderly to the late Emenike, adding that he was a security aide to Emenike’s friend, who was in company with both friends to the house of Hon. Mariam Onuoha to celebrate her victory in last Saturday’s Okigwe North re-run election. The commandant explained further that following preliminary investigations, “the officer was assisting to control crowd in Hon. Onwudiwe’s compound, when an unidentified person hit him from behind and the gun fell off his hands and shot the deceased.” He said the officer was not a drunkard as alleged “as I have not known him to be drinking.” Ibrahim appealed to the family members, the community, Imo people and Nigerians in general to be calm as proper investigation would be carried out and the law would take its course, accordingly.
