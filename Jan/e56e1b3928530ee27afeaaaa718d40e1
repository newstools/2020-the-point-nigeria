The National Organising Secretary of Afenifere, Mr. Kole Omololu, has criticised the comments of the National Leader of the All Progressives Congress, Asiwaju Bola Tinubu, on Amotekun, the South-West security outfit. Tinubu had, on Wednesday, broken his silence on Amotekun in a press statement, calling for a national dialogue on the matter. The Afenifere secretary, however, reacted in a statement, on Wednesday, that Tinubu was playing what he described as “political neutrality” at the detriment of the burning issues at hand. He indicated that the APC national leader should have condemned, in clear terms, the position of the Attorney General of the Federation, Abubakar Malami (SAN), that Operation Amotekun was illegal, and lacked constitutional backing. Omololu said, “His Excellency, Asiwaju’s statement is what is called political correctness. Leaders should talk boldly on a precarious situation. Asiwaju refused to comment on other para-military forces like Hisbah and civilian JTF in the north. “He did not read between the lines that the AGF’s statement is that of panic. Panic in the sense that the Amotekun phenomena unify the Yoruba Nation, regardless of political affiliations. It has the total and absolute support of all the children of Oduduwa and also other nationalities apart from the Fulanis.” He added, “It is a unity that is dangerous for a government that is nepotic and whose agenda on true federalism is not clear. The Yoruba nation is an utterly and incredibly resilient one. We are focused and not dissuaded by any statement by one million Bola Ahmed Tinubu when we know we are just and sincere. “Asiwaju’s statement is a pile of waffle, a dubious exercise in self-seeking sophistry and equivocation.”
