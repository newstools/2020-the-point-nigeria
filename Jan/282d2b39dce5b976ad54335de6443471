…court grants him N10m bail The Economic and Financial Crimes Commission, on Monday, arraigned former senator representing Kaduna Central Senatorial District in the National Assembly, Shehu Sani, on a two-count charge of bribery and advance fee fraud. Sani was, however, granted N10million bail by a Federal High Court, Abuja. Justice Inyang Ekwo, granted the former lawmaker bail shortly after he was arraigned by the EFCC. Sani was produced in court for the first time since his arrest and detention by the EFCC on December 31, 2019. Justice Ekwo dismissed EFCC’s opposition to Sani’s bail application in a ruling he delivered after hearing argument and counter-arguments by the defence and prosecution teams. In granting him bail, the judge ordered Sani to produce a responsible citizen with a landed asset worth the N10million bail sum as surety. He also ordered the defendant to deposit his passport with the court’s registry and directed that he must not travel out of the country without express permission of the court. The judge also directed the court’s registry to verify the assets and title documents to be tendered as a guarantee by the surety. He also ordered the court’s registry to notify in writing the Nigeria Immigration Services that the defendant’s passport was in its custody. He then adjourned trial till February 24, 25 and 26.
