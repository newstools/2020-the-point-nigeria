The Nigerian Railway Corporation has said that the Lagos-Ogun mass transit train service will resume operations on Thursday. The District Manager of NRC in Lagos, Mr Jerry Oche, who disclosed this in Lagos on Wednesday, said that the operation, which was suspended in September 2019, would resume with one return trip daily. This, he said, would be from Kajola in Ogun to Iddo in Lagos. He said, “We hope to resume the Lagos mass transit tomorrow, Thursday. We will start with just one return trip tomorrow. A return trip for us is to and fro. “Part of the reasons we are operating one trip is to conduct trials on the tracks that have just been done and also because of the construction of standard gauge rail line ongoing.” “The implication is that if we put more trains on the tracks, there might be issues of crossing. All we want to do now is one return trip each day for some time before we fully bounce back,” he added. The corporation had, in September 2019, suspended daily train services, including Mass Transit Train Services, on the narrow gauge, from Ijoko in Ogun to Ebute-Meta and Apapa in Lagos State.
