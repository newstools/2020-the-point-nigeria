One of the cardinal ways to reduce poverty in the developing economies of the world is to pay premium on maintenance culture of infrastructure, the World Bank has said. The bank, which spoke through a Consultant on the Rural Access And Agricultural Marketing Project (RAAMP), during a courtesy call on the Commissioner for Rural Development in Ogun State, on Thursday, in Abeokuta, the state capital, regretted that most of the pro-poor initiatives of governments suffer lack of sustainability. The Consultant to the World Bank, Abdulmalik Ibrahim, said, “The Bank is concerned that we are not doing well enough in the various strata of governance when it comes to maintaining infrastructure; the rural roads and agro- logistic hubs components of RAAMP has to be different. “We, therefore, like to see for a fact that the equipment, personnel and experience of rural road maintenance agency are in place as part of supporting mechanism for project effectiveness, Ibrahim corroborated the earlier position of the representative of the Federal Project Management Unit, Mr. Bukar Gana, that the ” revalidation of re- prioritized roads and agro-logistics hubs alignment would get necessary support for smooth project take off.” Earlier in his welcome remarks, the Commissioner for Rural Development, Taiwo Oludotun, assured the global bank of the readiness of the Prince Dapo Abiodun-led government to redefine governance to impact the grassroots. Oludotun said, “We are redefining governance to the extent that a bottom-top approach whereby we ask for peoples input is the order of the day. “The old order when government determines what the people want on her own whims and caprices is over.”
