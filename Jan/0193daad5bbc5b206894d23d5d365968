Imo State House of Assembly Speaker, Collins Chiji, on Tuesday, defected to the All Progressives Congress from the Peoples Democratic Party. Seven other lawmakers also defected from the PDP to the APC along with Chiji. The speaker announced his defection and that of his colleagues during a plenary, which lasted for 15 minutes and ended immediately after Chiji made public the names of the defecting lawmakers. Apart from the speaker, others who defected are Uche Ogbuagu (Ikeduru), Dominic Ezerioha (Oru West) Chigozie Nwaneri(Oru East), Kanayo Onyemaechi (Owerri West), Kennedy Ibe (Obowo) Onyemaechi Njoku (Ihitte/Uboma), and Eddy Obinna (Aboh Mbaise). With the defections, APC now has 18 lawmakers while PDP is left with only eight in the Imo State House of Assembly. Action Allianceâ€™s Uju Onwudiwe (Njaba), who was declared the winner of the supplementary election held last Saturday, has yet to be sworn-in by the speaker.
