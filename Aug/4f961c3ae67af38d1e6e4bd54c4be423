GOVERNOR Douye Diri of Bayelsa State has said he will appeal the ruling of the state election petition tribunal sitting in Abuja, which nullified the election that produced him. Diri, shortly after the tribunal’s ruling, on Monday, said he had instructed his lawyers to file the necessary papers. “We trust in the judiciary and we are appealing the judgment. With God on our side, we will get justice. This is a court of first instance and I have instructed our lawyers to file an appeal. We have a right of appeal even up to the Supreme Court,” he said. The governor urged members of the Peoples Democratic Party and his supporters not to panic, saying they should remain calm and law-abiding. Meanwhile, his predecessor, Seriake Dickson, has also reacted to the ruling, calling on Bayelsa indigenes not to be disturbed. He said the ruling was a temporary setback, which would not affect the status quo until appeal processes were exhausted. In a statement issued by his media adviser, Fidelis Soriwei, on Monday, Dickson said the PDP and the government would appeal the judgment. “I urge Bayelsans to remain calm. They shouldn’t misinterpret what took place at the tribunal today. The judgment is a temporary setback which does not have any effect on the status quo until all processes of appeal are exhausted,” he said. “There is no vacancy in the Bayelsa Government House. Douye Diri remains governor until the Supreme Court decides. Of course what this means is that the PDP will appeal this decision,” he added. A three-member tribunal panel held on Monday that the election was unlawful, owing to the exclusion of the Action Democratic Party and its candidate, King George, from the governorship election. The election was held on November 16, 2019. The tribunal therefore ordered the Independent National Electoral Commission to conduct a bye election within 90 days.
