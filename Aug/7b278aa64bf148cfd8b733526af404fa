A 44-year-old woman, Adetoro Olawuni, has been remanded at the correctional center for allegedly pouring a substance suspected to be acid on her husband, Michael Olapoju Olawuni, over a disagreement. An Osun Magistrateâ€™s Court, sitting in Osogbo, refused her bail on the objection of the police. The Police Prosecutor, ASP Fagboyinbo Abiodun, told the court that the woman did commit the offense on September 12, 2017 at about 1:00 am at Prime area, Osogbo. Fagboyinbo alleged that the defendant and another one, at large, did unlawfully cause grievous harm to Mr. Olawuni in the middle of the night. He further said that the defendant did unlawfully cause the victim injuries by pouring a substance suspected to be acid on his body. He stated that the offense was committed contrary to and punishable under Sections 516, 335, and 338 of the Criminal Code Cap 34 Vol ll, Law of Osun State, 2002. The defendant pleaded not guilty to the allegation preferred against him by the police. Defense Counsel, Okobe Najite, applied for the bail of the defendant in the most liberal term. The prosecutor opposed the bail application of the counsel, saying that the victim was in serious condition and yet to recover. He argued that the defendant absconded since 2017 and that granting her bail would give her the opportunity to run away again. In his ruling, Magistrate Abayomi Ajala ordered the remand of the defendant in Ilesa correctional center. The matter was adjourned till September 8, 2020, for ruling on a formal bail application.
