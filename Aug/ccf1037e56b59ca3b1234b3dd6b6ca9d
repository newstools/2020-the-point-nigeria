NO fewer than 800 vehicles have been impounded by the operatives of the Federal Road Safety Corps. Corps Marshal, Federal Road Safety Corps, Boboye Oyeyemi, disclosed this during the agency’s First Half of the Year 2020 Strategy Session in Abuja. According to him, the articulated vehicles were impounded in less than two weeks of the beginning of Operation Scorpion II.
He added that the exercise, which started on Monday, Aug 10, became necessary to prevent accidents, as a result of falling containers. Oyeyemi noted, “We recorded successful operations since we started and we will continue to put surveillance on the road to ensure maximum compliance with road traffic rules. “We have impounded 800 articulated vehicles in less than two weeks of the Operation Scorpion II and 150 offenders have been prosecuted. We have tackled the safety risk associated with unlatched containerised cargoes being conveyed on flatbed trucks through the ongoing special enforcement patrols. “We have agreed jointly with the Nigerian Port Authority to have a surveillance team within the various corridors as we need to tackle it from the root and on the highway as well.”
