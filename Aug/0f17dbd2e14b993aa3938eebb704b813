â€¦ as residents cry for help RESIDENTS in parts of Edo State have been thrown into confusion over the disaster caused by the less than two hours of heavy downpour in the state on Monday. The situation report coming in from communities across the state was so pathetic that Edo residents had to take to their social media handles to cry out for help. Residents of Uselu community, Ugbowo, Oluku, among others, were greatly affected, as not only was the access road submerged in flood, some vehicles were also swept away by the flood. At Okpagha Road, Aduwawa, Eyean community and environs, it was a similar experience as residents are presently in a state of uncertainty over the havoc wreaked by the downpour, The Point reports. A resident at Eyaen community told our correspondent that he watched his car carried away by the flood. Sapele road was another badly hit zone; commuters and residents have been stranded as well. Report coming in from Igbanke is even more worrisome. The road that was constructed by the Delta State Governor, Ifeanyi Okowa, reportedly, as bait to encourage the Igbanke people to vote for Obaseki, was completely washed away. Igbe road, inaugurated by Obaseki last weekend, was also washed away by the downpour. Shops, houses and vehicles around the area were submerged as their owners watched helplessly. On why the state records so much losses with every rainfall, respondents blamed the lack of continuity in the Benin City Water Storm project and the blockage of drainages for the unfortunate situation.
