FORMER Emir of Kano, Muhammad Sanusi ll, arrived Kaduna, on Sunday morning, amid a rousing welcome by a large crowd of residents. This is the first time the former Governor of the Central Bank of Nigeria would be visiting the North since the Government of Governor Abdullahi Ganduje of Kano State dethroned him about five months ago. He was last seen in Kaduna during the birthday ceremony of the Governor of Kaduna State, Mallam Nasir El-Rufai. The Governor stood firmly by the former Emir after his dethronement, and appointed him, almost immediately, as Pro Chancellor, Kaduna State University; and Vice Chairman of Kano State Investment Promotion Council. Sanusi is expected to be in Kaduna for a week, after which he might leave for Sokoto to see the Sultan, Muhammad Saâ€™ad Abubakar. He is expected to go from there to Azare, Katagum, where his grandfather stayed after his dethronement, according to sources. Sanusi arrived the Air Force base around 10.40am on Sunday, along with his wives, in a private plane, and was received by traditional rulers from Kaduna and Kano.
