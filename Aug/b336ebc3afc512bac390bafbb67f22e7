A woman who had been declared missing for days in Rivers State, Mrs Chizoba Eke, has been found inside a well. The Police traced the victim to the well when her abductor was intercepted by a team of policemen on a ‘stop and search’ operation at Omerelu, a boundary community between Rivers and Imo states. The woman was found inside a well in an uncompleted building around Igwuruta Community in Ikwerre Local Government Area of the state. The mother of two was kidnapped from her house, along with her six-month-old baby. She was said to have been thrown into the well after severe beating by her abductor. Luck, however, ran out on the suspect when he was intercepted with his victim’s baby by the team of policemen.
Chizoba’s husband, Eke Eke, confirmed his wife’s abduction and rescue. He disclosed that he was invited by the police to come and identify the baby, having lodged a complaint about his missing wife and baby. Eke said the suspect, known as Chinedu, had initially acted in a nice way by giving him a job, after which he invited him over to do the job. He said while on the job, the suspect turned back to his house and attempted to rape his wife. Chizoba, who was in pain due to the head injuries she sustained, said her husband wanted her to come to Chinedu’s house to collect some money. He then grabbed her, beat her up and threw her into the deep well. The Police Public Relations Officer in Rivers, Nnamdi Omoni, also confirmed the incident. He said the Divisional Police Officer at the police station in Igwuruta informed him that a woman was immediately taken to the hospital after she was rescued from a well. He said further investigation was ongoing on the matter.
