IN what appeared like an account of his stewardship as National Chairman of the ruling All Progressives Congress, Comrade Adams Oshiomhole gave himself a pat on the back, saying he is satisfied with his accomplishments within two years in office. Oshiomhole spoke during the welcome party hosted in his honour by the APC family in Etsako Central Local Government. The former labour leader, in his quintessential manner, turned the reception into a rally of sort, delving into life after his exit as national chairman of the APC. Oshiomole arrived Fugar, venue of the reception in a motorcade, clad in his trademark khaki trouser and long sleeved shirt, accompanied by top APC chieftains in the state, including the APC governorship candidate, Pastor Ize-iyamu and his deputy, Hon Gani Audu. Waxing philosophical, Oshiomole drew examples from the life and times of Jesus Christ to illustrate how those he trusted and assisted ended up betraying him He said, “It’s not the number of years one spends on earth that matters. Rather, it’s the fulfillment of a mission that matters most. “Jesus spent only 33 years on earth, but he was able to fulfill his mission, hence he is still remembered for his works. “So, you can be hundred years old and, yet, nobody remembers you for anything. I spent two years as national chairman, l am at peace with myself. I brought changes to the position. Change is what most people don’t accept easily.” He showered praises on the people of Etsako Central who turned out in their multitude to honour him, stressing that their show of support and solidarity gave him hope and fulfillment about the future. The highpoint of the event was the introduction of Pastor Ize-iyamu and his deputy to the teeming crowd of party enthusiasts, with an admonition that the duo deserved their votes in the September 19 guber poll.
