THE Federal Government has said that no Nigerian was among the casualties of the August 4 explosion in Beirut, Lebanon. The deadly explosion, which claimed over 150 lives and injured hundreds, was reportedly caused by a blast, which occurred inside a warehouse. The blast was said to have released a strong shockwave that caused catastrophic damage to infrastructure and buildings in different parts of Beirut. While commiserating with the Lebanese government, the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, in a statement on Monday, said it was in solidarity with Lebanon in this period of grief. The statement, signed by the Spokesperson for the Ministry, Ferdinand Nwonye, said, “The Federal Government of Nigeria wishes to commiserate with the government and people of Lebanon over the August 4, 2020, deadly explosion that occurred in the main seaport in Beirut. “The Government of Nigeria is in solidarity with the nation of Lebanon in this period of grief and calls for international support to facilitate the rebuilding process.” “The Ministry of Foreign Affairs wishes to inform the general public that reports from the Embassy of Nigeria in Beirut indicate that, so far, there is no reported case of Nigerian nationals among the dead but the host authorities are still assessing the impact of the damage caused by the massive explosion,” it added.
