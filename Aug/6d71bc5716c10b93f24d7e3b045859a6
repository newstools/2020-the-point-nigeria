THE Debt Management Office, on Thursday, said it had lifted the suspension on the issuance of the FGN Savings bond. This development is coming four months after the Federal Government placed a ban on the issuance of the debt securities. The DMO had in April suspended the bond offer, following restrictions associated with the outbreak of the COVID-19 pandemic. The agency, in a statement on Thursday, said the debt securities would be on offer from next Monday. FGN Savings Bond is specifically targeted at retail investors and includes a guaranteed interest payment and repayment of the principal. It is usually issued by the DMO on behalf of the Nigerian government. The statement said, “The Debt Management Office wishes to announce the resumption of its Offer of the Federal Government of Nigeria Savings Bond (FGN Savings Bond), effective August 2020. “The DMO was constrained to suspend the monthly offers of the FGN Savings Bond in April 2020 due to the restrictions on activities and movement, as part of measures adopted by the government to curtail the spread of COVID-19.” The DMO urged the general public to look out for the advertisement of the offer for subscriptions on the DMO’s website. “The Offer for subscription will open on Monday, August 10, 2020 and close on Friday, August 14, 2020,” the statement added. It encouraged investors to continue saving through the FGN Savings Bond, as they attract good incomes and are secure.
