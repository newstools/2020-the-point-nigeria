THE Federal Government has shifted resumption of international flights from August 29 to September 5. The Nigerian Civil Aviation Authority announced this on Thursday, citing aviation logistics reasons. The Director-General, NCAA, Musa Nuhu, announced the new date at the briefing of the Presidential Task Force on COVID-19 on Thursday. The DG said, “Since the announcement by the honourable Minister of Aviation, a few weeks ago, that international flights will resume anytime from the 29th of August, the aviation sector has worked assiduously to be ready for this date. The aviation sector, including the airports, are ready to resume on the 29th. “However, we have further non-aviation logistics we’re still working on, mostly to do with the COVID-19 protocols, tests, and also the online platform. We need to get these ready and in place so that we will have a smooth and efficient resumption for the international flights without difficulties for all passengers.” He added, “For this reason, unfortunately, I have to let you know that the resumption date has been shifted by one week to 5th of September, which is now a sacrosanct date. “The initial announcement was any time from the 29th. Now, we have fixed a date, 5th of September, to ensure a sacrosanct date for the resumption of international flights. In due course, very shortly, we will be announcing the protocols, once these logistics are done, and we will be giving further details.”
