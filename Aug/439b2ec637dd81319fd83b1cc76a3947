A suspected serial killer, Sunday Shodipe, who had escaped from the Oyo State Police custody, has been re-arrested, a few hours after the Police announced a N500,000 compensation for anyone who could facilitate his rearrest. The suspect, Sunday Shodipe, male, had initially been arrested on July 17, and paraded along with two others, at the Command’s Headquarters, Eleyele, Ibadan. He was later remanded in police custody, after the last killing of one Olufunmilayo, around Ori Oke Olorunkunle, in Akinyele. Shodipe was however said to have escaped from custody on August 11. About six persons were reportedly killed in cruel circumstances in the same area. The Command’s Public Relations Officer, Olugbenga Fadeyi, urged members of the public to contact men and officers of the Command for useful information that could lead to the suspect’s re-arrest. The Police later offered a compensation of N500,000 for anyone who could facilitate the rearrest of the suspect. The Oyo State House of Assembly had called on the Inspector-General of Police, Mohammed Adamu, to order a thorough investigation into circumstances surrounding Shodipe’s. Some angry youths had also marched to the Police headquarters at Eleyele, to protest the escape of the suspected serial killer.
