The Ebonyi State Secondary Education Board has suspended some principals in the state for collecting illegal levies during the ongoing 2020 West African Senior School Certificate Examination. The Chairman of the Board, Elizabeth Ezeani, who declared them suspended, ordered them to refund the collected fees in full and proceed to the board headquarters for their queries. The Board chairman discovered the anomaly during the Board’s school-to-school supervision of the ongoing examination exercise to ensure that all the schools observed the safety protocols of the Nigeria Centre for Disease Control and the Federal Ministry of Education. Ezeani, who made this known in a statement issued in Abakaliki, obtained by The Point, urged students, parents and guardians to report to law enforcement agencies, anybody demanding unapproved fees from them with respect to the ongoing WAEC examination for appropriate sanctions. She said, “Parents and guardians are to report to law enforcement agencies any body demanding unapproved fees from them during this ongoing WAEC examination. And those principals who collected such monies should refund them immediately or face disciplinary actions from the board.
“The underlisted principals are by this announcement suspended with immediate effect for act capable to breach peace in this ongoing WAEC examination in the state. They are however directed to handover to the Vice Principal Academics, and should proceed to SEB headquarters to collect their queries. “The principals include: Mr Opoke Leonard of Abarigwe Ishieke; Omiji Simon of Community Secondary School Ojiegbe; Ndubueze Ata Emmanuel of Community Secondary School Ndiagu Agbaja; and Theresa Anwu, Iziha Girls’ Secondary School, among others.
