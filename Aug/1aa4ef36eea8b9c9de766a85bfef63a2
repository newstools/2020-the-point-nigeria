THE Bayelsa Governorship Election Tribunal has nullified the election that produced the candidate of the Peoples Democratic Party, Duoye Diri, as Governor. The three-member tribunal panel held that the election was unlawful, owing to the exclusion of the Action Democratic Party and its candidate, King George, from the governorship election. The election was held on November 16, 2019. The tribunal therefore ordered the Independent National Electoral Commission to conduct a bye election within 90 days. Details later..
