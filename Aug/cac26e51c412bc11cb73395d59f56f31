THE Department of State Security has met with key leaders of the All Progressives Congress over stakeholders’ concern about security issues as the Edo State Governorship election, slated for September 19, 2020, approaches. The meeting between the DSS and the APC leaders, 10 of them, was held at the DSS office in Benin City on Saturday. In a letter dated August 20, 2020, referenced ‘171/B/122’ and addressed to Tony Adun, the DSS invited, along with him, the National Chairman, Road Transport Employers Association of Nigeria, Osakpamwan Eriyo; APC Leader Oredo, Ehis Adams; APC Leader (Ikpoba-Okha), Osaro Idahosa; and APC Leader (Ovia South West), Okunbor Roberts; among others. The meeting, it was gathered, held as scheduled and focused on the need for all concerned to shun violence in the interest of the people of the state. The leaders were also reportedly told to prevail on their supporters not to engage in violence of any form. A source said that the APC claimed that its campaigns had been peaceful, while accusing the Peoples Democratic Party of violence that had been recorded, so far, in the state. The DSS, it was gathered, would also meet PDP leaders very soon.
