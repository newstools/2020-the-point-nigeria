MICHAEL Ojo, a Nigerian basketball player, who previously played for Red Star Belgrade is dead. Ojo, who had been without a club since June 30, but was still training with Red Star, died at the age of 27. Red Star’s spokesperson, Igor Vujicin, in a press statement, on Friday, said the Nigerian died during a training session in Serbia. “We are deeply saddened by the news”, Vujicin told AFP. The club could not confirm the cause of death, but local media reported that Ojo suffered a heart attack during training. Born in Lagos, the 2.16 metre (7ft 1in) centre played for Florida State University in the United States before coming to Europe to start his professional career. After a stint with the Belgrade team FMP Zeleznik, he moved to European giants Red Star, where he spent two seasons, quickly becoming a fan favourite. His former team, Red Star, has released a statement mourning the loss of the “cheerful giant”. “The sudden and shocking death of Michael Ojo has deeply affected everyone — players, coaches and the management of a club that accepted him from the first day, and that he considered his own,” the team said.
