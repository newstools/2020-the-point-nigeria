FORMER Minister of Aviation, Femi Fani-Kayode, on Wednesday, apologised for calling a Daily Trust reporter, Eyo Charles, stupid. The Peoples Democratic Party chieftain had come under attack on social and mainstream media after a video, where he was seen insulting the Cross River-based journalist, for asking a question he deemed offensive, went viral. Fani-Kayode used denigrating words on the reporter, and repeated a few times that he was stupid for asking him who bankrolled his trips. The reporter has since stated his side of the story, berating the former minister for throwing caution to the wind in an embarrassing manner. Fani-Kayode said, “I met with my advisors till late last night and I wish to say the following. I hereby withdraw the word ‘stupid’, which I used in my encounter with a journalist in Calabar. I have many friends in the media who I offended by losing my cool and using such words. I hereby express my regrets for doing so. “I do however wish to state categorically that no threat of physical harm was ever made to the journalist in question and neither did I send anyone to threaten him. Anyone that says otherwise is lying and I challenge them to bring the proof. I would never seek to physically harm a journalist. For the last 30 years, I have defended and worked with journalists and fought for the right of freedom of expression. “I am also very close to many in that profession. I would be the last to seek to disparage those that are honorable and noble within its ranks. “I hope that this will assuage the pain and anger of anyone that was hurt or offended by this ugly episode. I have now put this matter behind me and moved on. Now my tour of the South continues. Moving to yet another state today!”- FFK
