THE Presidential Candidate of the African Democratic Congress in the 2019 election, Dr. Obadiah Mailafia, has left the Department of State Services office in Jos. The former Deputy Governor of the CBN was released to go home after a brief Interraction with the DSS in relation to a statement that a sitting Northern Nigerian governor was the commander of the terrorist group, Boko Haram. The DSS had invited him hours after the video of the interview, which he granted an Abuja radio station, 95.1FM, went viral. The National Chairman of ADC, Chief Ralphs Nwosu, who confirmed Mailafia’s release to The Point’s correspondent, said he was glad that the comments the party’s presidential candidate made in good faith were not used against him. “Mailafia has just left the DSS office in Jos. To God be the glory. He just called me now. He said I was the first person he would call after leaving the office,” Nwosu said. Mailafia thanked Nigerians for their support and urged citizens to be law abiding and support the Federal Government in its effort at combating crime in all forms.
