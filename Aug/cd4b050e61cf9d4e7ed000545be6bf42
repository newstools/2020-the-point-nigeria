THE Academic Staff Union of Universities, University of Lagos branch, has condemned the purported removal of the Vice-Chancellor of the University, Prof. Oluwatoyin Ogundipe. The Chairman of the union, Dele Ashiru, who accused the Chairman of the Governing Council, Dr Wale Babalakin, of masterminding the Council’s action,said the move was aimed at destabilising the institution. “His removal is illegal and uncalled for. Our union condemns in the strongest term the purported removal. It is the machination of the pro-chancellor to destabilise this university,” he declared. “We reaffirm our confidence in the leadership of Professor Toyin Ogundipe as Vice-Chancellor of the university,” he added.
