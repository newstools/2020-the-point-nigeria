THE Nigeria Union of Journalists, Akwa Ibom chapter, has directed its members to boycott a press conference organised for a former Minister of Aviation, Femi Fani-Kayode. This directive followed the controversy that trailed what many have described as the former minister’s uncivilised behaviour towards a Daily Trust reporter, Eyo Charles, in Calabar, Cross River State. The NUJ, in a statement on Friday, told members not to attend any programme organised for Fani-Kayode. The Peoples Democratic Party chieftain began a tour of some states, especially PDP-controlled states in July. In the video of the Cross River press conference that went viral, Fani-Kayode was heard insulting Eyo Charles for asking him a question on who was bankrolling his trips. He threw caution to the winds and repeated words, such as stupid, while displaying his anger. “I could see from your face, before you got here, how stupid you are. Don’t ever talk to me like that. Who do you think you are talking to? Do you know who I am? Bankroll who? …You have a small mind; don’t judge me by your standards,” he said. The former minister’s conduct generated widespread criticism from Nigerians, while the journalist who was insulted also formally recounted his ordeal, saying Fani-Kayode threw caution to the wind in reaction to a simple question. The PDP chieftain also tendered his apology, saying “I withdraw the word ‘stupid'”. Details later…
