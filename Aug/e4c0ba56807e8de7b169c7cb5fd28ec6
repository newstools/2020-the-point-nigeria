THE Progressives Solidarity Forum has reacted to a statement by a group, Progressives Solidarity Front, warning the National Leader of the All Progressives Congress, Asiwaju Bola Tinubu, not to interfere in the forthcoming Governorship election in Edo State, particularly in view of what it described as the group’s offensive statements. The Director, Policy and Strategy, Progressives Solidarity Forum (PSF), Tajudeen Alabede, alleged in a statement, on Monday, that the objective of the Progressives Solidarity Front, led by Charles Obanor, was to discredit Tinubu. The statement said, “For the avoidance of doubt, Progressives Solidarity Forum (PSF), a global platform for progressive-minded Nigerian professionals, uses this medium to inform our stakeholders and indeed all Nigerians that we have nothing to do with the author of the statement, Charles Obanor, and his group. “As a progressive platform that is committed to the promotion of progressive governance in Nigeria, Progressives Solidarity Forum (PSF) has the highest regards for Asiwaju Bola Ahmed Tinubu and all the leaders of the progressive family in Nigeria. “We are worried by the misleading action of Charles Obanor as the name and acronym of the group that he chose to do the hatchet job bore striking semblance to our group’s. As a legal entity that was duly registered by the Corporate Affairs Commission and having built a strong reputation as a foremost progressive platform in Nigeria, we will take all legitimate steps to protect our group’s name.” PSF also urged relevant security and intelligence agencies to investigate Charles Obanor, whose offensive statement, it said, was antithetical to the fervent wish of all well-meaning Nigerians for issue-based electoral campaigns as well as peaceful and violence-free elections in Nigeria.
