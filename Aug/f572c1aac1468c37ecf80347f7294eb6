A woman, Lucy Kelsall, whose husband died as a result of throat cancer, has given birth to twins three years after his death. Lucy’s husband, David reportedly froze his sperm before treatment made him infertile. His sperm was taken by the doctors and used in making Lucy pregnant via IVF. The 37-year-old widow, who lost her husband in 2017, said she still can’t wrap her head around the fact that she has a bit of David with her forever-in the form of her twins. She gave birth to two healthy boys, named David and Samuel, after her second round of IVF. Speaking on fond memories of her husband, Lucy said, “A few days before he died, I told him I was still going to have his baby and he was so surprised and happy. “He looked so proud and he would have been an amazing father. One of them has David’s long legs and big feet because he had size 15 feet and one has his green eyes.” – Daily Mail
