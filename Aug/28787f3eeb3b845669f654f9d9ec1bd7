THE Lagos State High Court has remanded a truck driver, Sodiq Okanlanwan, and the truck owner, Wasiu Lekan, for killing three people in Lagos. Justice Mobolanle Okikiolu-Igihile of the Lagos State High Court, Igbosere, ordered that the offenders be remanded after they were arraigned in the court for alleged involuntary manslaughter. The duo are facing a three-count charge, filed against them by the Lagos State Government. The state Attorney-General and Commissioner for Justice, Moyosore Onigbanjo, SAN, told the court that the defendants committed the offences on July 26, 2020. He said Okanlanwan, on July 26, at about 4pm, on the Oshodi Expressway, in Ilasamaja, ran over the victims, with his vehicle. Onigbanjo said the defendant unlawfully killed one Nnaekpe Chima Victor, Chidinma Ajoku and Daniel Okwuoge, by running over them with his truck.
The offence, he said, was contrary to Section 224 and punishable under Section 229, of the Criminal Law of Lagos State. The defendants pleaded not guilty. In view of their plea, Onigbanjo prayed the court to remand the duo in police custody pending the outcome of their COVID-19 test result. They can then be remanded at the appropriate Correctional facility. Onigbanjo also asked for a short adjournment to commence the trial, but the defendantsâ€™ counsel, Emmanuel Okedi, who held the brief for M. A. Osagbede, objected to the short adjournment, noting that he needed to study the information as he was just being served a few minutes before the arraignment. Consequently, Justice Okikiolu-Ighile adjourned the case till August 20 and 26, for trial.
