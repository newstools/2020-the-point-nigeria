THE Joint Admissions and Matriculation Board is considering a new date for the commencement of the 2020 admission processes from the earlier announced date of August 22, 2020. The Board disclosed in its bulletin, released on Sunday, that it would be meeting all tertiary institutions on Monday, August 10, 2020, to brainstorm on the possibility of shifting the commencement to a date that would better accommodate the vagaries of the COVID-19 pandemic. It said, “As a responsive organisation, whose mantra is equity and fairness, the Board desires that every aspiring candidate who had taken its UTME be given equal opportunity to compete with his/her peers for the available openings. “This is the reason for its call for another meeting with all the institutions with a view to amending the earlier and mutually agreed date for the conduct of the Post-UTME screening and other processes.” According to JAMB, as intellectuals, it is incumbent on the Board and the various tertiary institutions to always provide practical solutions to perceived challenges for the smooth running of the sector without being prompted by the Government. “Such solutions, when arrived at, would then be forwarded to the relevant Ministries or agencies for further input and necessary approvals,” it said. “It is in view of this that the Board is working to preempt any unpalatable situation that may arise if institutions conduct their admissions without accommodating the vast number of candidates that are about to take their O’Level examinations,” it added.
