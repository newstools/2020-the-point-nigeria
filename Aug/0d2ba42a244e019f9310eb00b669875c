AS investigations continue on the claim that a Northern Governor is the Commander of Boko Haram in Nigeria, among others, the Nigerian Police has issued a separate invitation to a former Deputy Governor of the Central Bank of Nigeria, Obadiah Mailafia, for further interrogation. The Department of State Services had, shortly after the video of the interview Mailafia granted Nigeria Info went viral, invited him to its Jos office. He was released the same day after about six hours of interrogation. Mailafia said in the interview that he got his information from some repentant Boko Haram fighters. The Nigeria Police Force in a document referenced, ‘3000/X/FHQ/ABJ/VOl.245/8’, dated August 20, 2020, invited Mailafia, who was  the Presidential Candidate of the African Democratic Congress in the 2019 election, to its Force Criminal Investigation Department Complex, Garki Area 10, on Monday, August 24, 2020 at 11am. The letter said, “We wish to inform you that this office is investigating a case in which your name featured prominently. In light of the above, you are invited to an interview with the Deputy Inspector-General of Police, FCID Abuja, through the undersigned on Monday, August 24, 2020 by 11am at Room 407, 3rd Floor, FCID Complex, Area 10, Abuja. “Accept the assurances of the Deputy Inspector-General of Police, FCID.” Mailafia had, after his initial interrogation by the DSS, told journalists that he could not disown what he said, even though the DSS came out with a strong statement condemning his utterances.
