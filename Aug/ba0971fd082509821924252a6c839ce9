THE Federal Competition and Consumer Protection Council has shut the premises of Apple & Pears Limited for selling expired and unsafe products. The Director-General, FCCPC, Babatunde Irukera, said this in a statement issued in Abuja. He said, on Tuesday August 11, 2020, the Commission was informed that a consumer purchased Laziz vegetable oil in sachets produced by Apple & Pears Limited from their retail/storage location in Abuja. The representation, according to him, suggested that the food products during the time of purchase had expired. Upon further investigation, Irukera said the Commission discovered the company’s primary facility on the Lagos-Ibadan Express Way. He said, “Although locked, innocuous and without signage, the Commission also identified the specific location in Abuja where the company had stored its products. “Having sufficient initial evidence to proceed on enforcement, the Commission conducted investigations at both the Lagos-Ibadan Expressway, and Abuja locations. “The Commission discovered unreasonably large and inexplicable inventories of Laziz salad cream, Laziz mayonnaise, Laziz vegetable oil in sachets, and Laziz Thousand Island salad cream.” In addition, he said the Commission uncovered what appeared to be unapproved and unsafe production, decanting, or repackaging of vegetable oil at the Abuja location.
