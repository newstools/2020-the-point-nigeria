EMIR of Kano, HRH Aminu Ado Bayero, will arrive Ilorin, Kwara State capital, today (Thursday), according to a statement by the Kwara State Government. The new emir, whose mother is from the ancient city of Ilorin, replaced the former Governor of the Central bank of Nigeria, Muhammadu Sanusi II, as the 15th Emir of Kano from the Fulani clan. Sanusi was deposed on March 9, 2020, by Governor Abdullahi Ganduje, allegedly owing to political differences and the former’s strong independent views. A statement, on Thursday, released by the Kwara State Commissioner for Communications, Harriet Afolabi, a copy of which was made available to The Point, urged Kwara indigenes to accord the new emir a befitting welcome to his maternal home. The Emir is on an official visit to Ilorin. The statement said, “We call on citizens, especially those in the state capital Ilorin, to accord the revered Emir a welcome that is befitting of his distinguished royal stool. “The state government is indeed glad and honoured to welcome the Emir of Kano, and wishes His Royal Highness a memorable stay in the state of harmony.”
