THE Nigeria Broadcasting Commission has penalised Nigeria Info 99.3FM, Lagos, to the tune of N5 million, in relation to what it described as the unprofessional conduct of the radio station in handling the interview of the Presidential Candidate of the African Democratic Congress, Obadiah Mailafia. The fine, according to NBC, was levied against the radio station for providing its platform to be used to promote unverifiable and inciting views that can incite crime and public disorder. The Commission recently raised the fine for hate speech from N500,000 to N5 million. Mailafia had spoken in an interview on the ‘Morning Crossfire’ programme of the Nigeria Info Abuja, 95.1FM, on Monday, following which the Department of State Services invited him to its Jos Office for interrogation. He had said, based on information from some bandits who had repented, a northern governor was the Commander of the terrorist group, Boko Haram. He said, “Some of us also have our intelligence networks. I have met with some of the bandits; we have met with some of their high commanders – one or two who have repented – they have sat down with us not once, not twice. They told us that one of the northern governors is the commander of Boko Haram in Nigeria. “Boko Haram and the bandits are one and the same. They have a sophisticated network. During this lockdown their planes were moving up and down as if there was no lockdown.” The NBC, in a statement, on Thursday, titled, ‘The National Broadcasting Commission Fines Nigeria Info 99.3 For Unprofessional Broadcast”, said, “The National Broadcasting Commission has noted with grave concern, the unprofessional conduct of Nigeria Info 99.3FM, Lagos, in the handling of the Programme, “Morning Cross Fire”, aired on August 10, 2020, between 8.30am and 9.00am. “The station provided its platform for the guest, Dr. Mailafia Obadiah, to promote unverifiable and inciting views that could encourage or incite to crime and lead to public disorder. “Dr. Mailafia Obadiah’s comments on the ‘Southern Kaduna Crisis’, were devoid of facts and by broadcasting same to the public, Nigeria Info 99.3FM, is in violation of the following sections of the Nigeria Broadcasting Code: 3.1.1. No broadcast shall encourage or incite to crime, lead to public disorder or hate, be repugnant to public feelings or contain offensive reference to any person or organization, alive or dead or generally be disrespectful to human dignity; “3.1.2.
