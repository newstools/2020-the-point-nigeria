THE Department of State Services has invited the Presidential Candidate of the African Democratic Congress in the 2019 election, Obadiah Mailafia, to its Jos Office, in relation to his claim that a sitting Northern Nigerian governor is the Commander of the terrorist group, Boko Haram, in Nigeria. Mailafia, who told The Point that he had been invited to Jos, said he was in Jos for a university programme. The invitation by the DSS came hours after the video of his interview with Abuja radio station, 95.1FM, went viral. Mailafia was heard in the video saying that he had information from bandits operating in the Northern part of Nigeria that a serving Governor in the region was their commander, among other positions on the incessant killings in Southern Kaduna. He also said there was a plan to eliminate prominent Nigerians in their homes in urban cities, as revealed by a repentant bandit. Meanwhile, the African Democratic Congress had, on Tuesday, described as mischievous, the reproduction of the audio interview, saying the interview was misrepresented and reproduced without his consent. The party said, while it was its position that the President Muhammadu Buhari administration seemed to be paying lip service to the issue of combating crime on all fronts, Obadiah’s remarks were sensationalised. The National Chairman of ADC, Chief Ralphs Nwosu, who spoke in a statement, he personally signed on Tuesday, said the party had been inundated with calls ever since the video went viral, but reminded President Buhari that his administration must sit up because “there is a thin line between oppression and revolution.” ADC said, as the credible alternative to the ruling party and the Peoples Democratic Party, Mailafia was only echoing its views about the complicity of the current administration in the unfortunate killings.
