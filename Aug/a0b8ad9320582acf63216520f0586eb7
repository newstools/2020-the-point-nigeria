A violent clash between security agents and members of the Indigenous People of Biafra has claimed many lives in Emene, Enugu. The clash, which occurred on Sunday morning, threw residents of the community into confusion, while worshippers, who had gone to Church in the morning, ran helter skelter to save their lives. The crisis was said to have erupted at about 7am, when security operatives reportedly stormed the Community Secondary School in Emene, where IPOB members were allegedly holding a meeting. The IPOB members were said to have resisted the attempt to disperse them, which resulted in a bloody encounter, where scores of people reportedly lost their lives and many sustained major injuries. It was learnt that the operatives called for reinforcement when it seemed that the IPOB members were overpowering them, which led to the deployment of many patrol vans loaded with armed men, including the operatives of the Department of State Services, Army and Police to the crisis centre. There were sporadic gunshots in the area, while teargas fumes filled the air, according to eyewitnesses, as the operatives chased fleeing IPOB members. The tension was around St Patrick Secondary School and St Joseph Catholic Church, by the old Abakaliki Road. The Police Public Reltions Officer could not be reached to comment on the incident as of the time of filing this report.
