December 19 2015 All the five children of Sunday Michael Ayolabi, a shepherd (pastor) of the Celestial Church of Christ, Ibudo- Iyanu, Ogba area of Lagos State, have testified that their father is acting under the influence of some charms placed on him by his newly found love, Yetunde. “Since she moved in, our father has started doing unthinkable things in the house; such as stealing raw rice, beans and garri from our mother’s store. He steals to give to his new wife. On several occasions, he had threatened that he would one day pour acid on us while we are asleep. That is why we have added more bolts to our door, because, he could do it,” Ayolabi’s female children told a customary court sitting in Agege, Lagos. The children, some already married with children, but still living with their parents, further said that their father lied against their mother, Modupe Ayolabi, when he accused her of sending his church members away. Ayolabi is praying the court to dissolve his 25-year-old union, saying, “My wife has driven away my church members and has been threatening the life of my second wife; and I am fed up.” But his children said their father had never been responsible for their upkeep and that it was their mother who had been struggling to take care of them. They also pointed out that their mother owned the land on which Ayolabi built his parish. The court, however, adjoined the case for further hearing.
