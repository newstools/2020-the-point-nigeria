.. Etsako East declares total support for Governor A former aide of the former National Chairman of the All Progressives Congress, Adams Oshiomhole, has dumped the APC for Governor Godwin Obaseki’s Peoples Democratic Party. The former aide, Andrew Momodu, also donated N5m in support of Obaseki’s re-election. Meanwhile, the people of Etsako East Local Government Area of Edo North have pledged their support for Obaseki, saying while others had neglected the community, Obaseki connected them back to the state with good roads. The Eramah Anwian of Anwain Kingdom, Etsako East LGA of Edo North, HRM Mufutairu Oare, assured the Governor that the people of his community would double whatever he hoped to get from them in the governorship election. The monarch, while addressing the Governor, said, “We are assuring you that you are at home. This community road has been a disaster for over a thousand years until your intervention. We were cut off from Edo State until you gave us a good road that integrated us back as members of the state. “We cannot forget such a gesture. The government comes and goes and no government remembers that we exist. But Obaseki came and connected us back to the state through good roads.” He added, “It took 24hours to come out from the community to the main road but today, the story is no more the same. In less than an hour, you can now approach various parts of the state due to a good network of roads. “We were preparing a carnival to receive you on the 12th of this month but you came today, otherwise, you would have known what is called a reception of honour. Go to other areas to campaign, you don’t need to campaign in this community because this community has no other option than the PDP. Anywhere Obaseki/Shaibu stands, that’s where the entire Anwain community will stand.”
