THE Academic Staff Union of Universities has said it will continue its ongoing strike action until the Federal Government meets all its demands. The Union said the demands of its members were genuine and in the interest of Nigeria with respect to the implementation of the 2012 University Needs Assessment. President, ASUU, Biodun Ogunyemi, said this at the weekend, during an interactive meeting with stakeholders at the University of Port Harcourt, Rivers State. He wondered why university lecturers would still be receiving the same salaries they received in 2009, in 2020, vowing that the strike action would not be suspended until the issues were addressed. Ogunyemi said, “What we are asking government to do are not baseless things. In 2012, the Federal Government conducted a NEEDS Assessment survey and found out that there was widespread rot and decay in the university system. We are asking Government to implement its own report of 2012. Salary issues are still there, and we have not fully addressed that. “It appears that some forces in government are bent on suffering our members by withholding their salaries. But we believe that once we sort out the issues of the Universities Transparency and Accountability Solution, other issues will fall in place. The 2009 agreement we had with government stipulates that the agreement would be reviewed every three years. “But since then, we have not been able to review the salary scale. That is why we are saying that the negotiation we started with government in 2017 ought to have been completed.”
