THE Peoples Democratic Party’s National Campaign Council on Edo governorship election has berated the candidate of the All Progressives Congress, Osagie Ize-Iyamu, for loafing around with those it described as hired campaigners, following his rejection by the Edo State chapter of the APC. In a statement signed by the National Publicity Secretary of the party, Kola Ologbondiyan, the PDP said, “Ize-Iyamu, who has been reduced to a political wanderer, is hovering around without the backing and participation of his party in Edo State, following their rejection of his defective nomination process, which has turned him to an invalid candidate.” The party said Ize-Iyamu had since been deserted by his party after the Edo State Chairman of the APC, Anslem Ojezua, declared that the APC had no candidate, adding that this explained why he was not campaigning for Ize-Iyamu. The statement said, “Nigerians can now see why Ize-Iyamu’s campaign does not have the participation of APC members in the state and why he is stuck with the sacked National Chairman of the APC, Adams Oshiomhole, who also has no party, having been dismissed from the APC by his kinsmen in his ward. “This is why Ize-Iyamu’s rallies are attended only by hired campaigners brought for him by the “partyless” Oshiomhole, from Kogi, Imo and other states; hirelings who cannot even respond to the slogan of the APC and have no electoral value in the Edo election. “With such public rejection by the Edo state APC, Ize-Iyamu has no legitimate space in the Edo electoral process since our laws do not recognize independent candidates.” The PDP counseled Ize Iyamu to stop wasting his time and embarrassing himself by following a “partyless” Oshiomhole, who it said was leading him to nowhere “as his thugs and hired campaigners cannot transform into votes.” The PDP said, “Moreover, the people of Edo State are already aware that he and his disgracefully sacked master are confused and only beating about the bush with strangers just to create an impression that they are actually in an electoral contest. “In any case, the veil will soon drop from Ize-Iyamu’s eyes on September 19, when the hired campaigners  would have ended their contract and abandon him to face the wrath of the ballot box.”
