THE Chairman of the Peoples Democratic Party Campaign Council for Edo State, Dan Orbih, has described the good outing of the party in Akoko Edo and the excitement with which the people embraced the party’s candidates, as exciting and a sign of victory. The PDP recently flagged off its ward-to-ward campaign in Igarra, Akoko Edo, where the indigenes openly endorsed Governor Godwin Obaseki, the party’s candidate for the September 19 Edo governorship poll. Orbih said the choice of Igarra for the flag-off was a carefully thought out political strategy to cripple the APC and garner sufficient votes to enable the PDP defeat its opponent. According to the former Edo State PDP Chairman, Edo North remains the hope for the APC godfather, “having lost clout and relevance in the other two senatorial districts because of his unstable and flip-flop character.” “With the flag-off of our party’s campaign, using the same face of a man the people had come to love and whom Oshiomhole eulogised as most suited for the job, the APC is now dead and buried in Edo North,” he said. He expressed optimism about the election, pointing out that the party’s good outing at the Akoko Edo rally had, indeed, rekindled its hope of victory, urging INEC and the security agencies to guarantee a free, fair and credible election.
