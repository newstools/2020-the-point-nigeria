Oyo State Governor Seyi Makinde, on Saturday, ordered a dusk-to-dawn curfew in the state after two new confirmed cases were confirmed and 84 new suspected infections discovered. Makinde disclosed this via a series of tweets on Saturday morning. This is coming a few hours after the Nigeria Centre for Disease Control announced that Oyo had recorded three cases of COVID-19.
