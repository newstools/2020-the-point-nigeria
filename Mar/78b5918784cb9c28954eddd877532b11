…victim seriously injured, loses teeth A man, Fatai Sani, has allegedly thrown his former lover, Sherifat Olanrewaju, from the first floor of his one-storey apartment in the Mushin area of Lagos State.  Sani was also alleged to have earlier knocked off some of his ex-lover’s teeth before allegedly pushing her from the first floor of the building during a scuffle that ensued between the two of them over the owner of a generator.  The seriously injured woman is currently recuperating in a private hospital, where she was rushed to after the incident.  Our correspondent gathered that trouble began for Sherifat when she went to her former lover’s residence and attempted to retrieve her generator from him.  It was gathered that the former lovers had been separated after some irreconcilable differences.  She was said to have earlier raised the alarm when her ex-lover refused to release her generator to her.  But the two former lovers soon engaged each other in a brawl, culminating in Sani throwing Sherifat from the first floor of the building to the ground after allegedly knocking off some of her teeth.  Neighbours of the victim, who spoke with our correspondent, said the man had been arrested by the police in the area.  A resident of the area, Mr. Sikiru Akangbe, said, “Sherifat almost lost her life in the hands of the man when she attempted to retrieve her generator from him. She was beaten blue black by the man. They had been living together for long until they had a misunderstanding. That prompted her to attempt to retrieve her personal belongings from the man’s house.”  Another resident, who simply identified herself as Adeola, said, “There must be more to the matter before he could attempt to kill her by throwing her down from the first floor of the house.”  But in her own explanation, the victim, Olarewaju, said, “I only went to his house to collect my generator from him when he descended on me and threw me from the first floor of his house to the ground.”
