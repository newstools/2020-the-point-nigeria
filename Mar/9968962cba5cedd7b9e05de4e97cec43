Wife of the President, Mrs. Aisha Buhari, on Monday, has called for a total lockdown of activities across the country as coronavirus toll hits 36 with one death already recorded in the country. Mrs. Buhari specifically cited the case of state governors shutting down schools but allowing parents to continue to go to work. She noted that much as the move by the governors was commendable, it could be counterproductive if the parents continued to report for work. The President’s wife on her twitter handle on Monday, @aishambuhari, tweeted, “It is commendable that state governors have closed down schools; however, this could be counterproductive if parents are still going to work. “We should not isolate students and expose their parents. “Let us remember that they will meet at home. “#TotalLockDown “#StayAtHome.” Recall that one of President’s daughters, who recently returned from the United Kingdom, is in self-isolation on the advice of the Nigeria Centre for Disease Control. Mrs Buhari had announced the development by herself last week.
