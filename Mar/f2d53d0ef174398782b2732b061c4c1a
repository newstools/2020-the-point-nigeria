Lagos State Commissioner for Health, Prof. Akin Abayomi, on Tuesday, denied knowledge of the location of the Chief of Staff to the President, Abba Kyari, in Lagos. Kyari, who tested positive for coronavirus last week, in a statement on Sunday, said he would be in Lagos on Monday for “further tests and observations.” Abayomi said, “I’m not aware of the Chief of Staff’s itinerary, so I don’t know where he is, we chat on WhatsApp but I cannot tell where he is from our chat. “We are exchanging information but I haven’t asked him for his location. He seems well and happy and we are exchanging information on strategic issues. It has been a long time we talked about his health, I presume he has made a full recovery.” The Commissioner said most of the patients at the Infectious Disease Hospital, Yaba, were suffering mild to moderate symptoms of the illness. He added, “Most of our patients are experiencing a very mild to moderate degree of illness; in fact, we don’t have anybody that requires ventilation at the moment which is a symptom of what we will describe as severe disease. “If we are to put some percentages on the 66 cases, about 33 of them are showing mild symptoms, the remaining 33 are showing moderate disease symptoms just characterised by severe fever, feeling weak, some coughing, headaches and body pains. It is not extending to affect the organs such that we have lung or kidney failure.”
