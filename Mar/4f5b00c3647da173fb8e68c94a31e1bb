The Federal Government said on Monday that it will recall retired doctors and nurses to help in the fight against coronavirus. The Minister of Health, Osagie Ehanire, disclosed this in Abuja while giving an update on the virus. Ehanire said 36 persons had so far been infected in the country, with 26 of them having travel history while six had contacts with infected persons. He added that four of the infected persons had no travel history or known contact with a confirmed case. The minister said one death had so far been recorded, explaining that the deceased died of complications from underlining illness, having just returned from the United Kingdom, where he had gone for treatment. He said, “We have advised that some states should issue a call for retired doctors and nurses to be able to be reabsorbed and come back to service for this particular period if the need arises. They can be recalled back to active duty. They are in the reserved pool. “As of this date, there are 36 cases of coronavirus in Nigeria. Of these cases 25 are in Lagos, six are at the Federal Capital Territory, two are in Ogun, one in Edo, one in Ekiti and one in Oyo State. “26 have had a travel history to countries with high burden in the last two weeks, six are contacts of the confirmed cases and for four of them, we have not been able to trace recent travel history or trace known confirmed contact. Unfortunately, we recorded the first death of COVID-19 infection in the country. “This was a Nigerian who had underline illnesses and died due to complications on March 22, 2020, in Abuja. He had just returned from treatment in the United Kingdom. After successful treatment, two persons have been discharged. 32 are clinically stable with mild symptoms. One patient is dependent on oxygen.”
