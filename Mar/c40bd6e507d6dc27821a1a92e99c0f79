The police in Ogun State have arrested two suspects, Friday Ezi, 43 and Onyekachi Atama, 27, for stealing no fewer than seven vehicles belonging to different individuals at the Redemption Camp of the Redeemed Christian Church of God during various programmes of the church. The suspects were arrested following a report by one Titilayo Otitodogbon, who reported at the Redeemed Camp Police Station on February 1, 2020 the theft of her Toyota Camry car with registration number LND 636 EZ parked at Diligent Road, Redemption Camp. Following her report, the Divisional Police Officer, Redeemed Camp, CSP Chris Amanyi, detailed his detectives to investigate and bring the perpetrators to book. The state Police Public Relations Officer, DSP Abimbola Oyeyemi, said in a statement that the detectives embarked on full scale forensic and technical investigation, which yielded positive result when one Friday Ezi, who actually stole the car from the Redemption Camp was traced to Edo State, where he was arrested on March 10, 2020. Oyeyemi said his arrest and eventual confessional statement led police operatives to Onitsha in Anambra State, where one Onyekachi Atama, who is his receiver and an accomplice, was also arrested on March 15, 2020. The PPRO added that preliminary investigations revealed that the suspects had stolen up to seven different cars at the Redemption Camp, but they confessed to have stolen only two cars on different occasions. Atama, who is a spare parts dealer at motor parts market in Onitsha, confessed that once the vehicles were brought to him by Ezi, he would canibalise it and sell them in parts. Oyeyemi further said that the stateâ€™s Commissioner of Police, Kenneth Ebrimson, who commended the investigative team for a job well-done, had directed that the suspects be transferred to Anti-car theft section of the State Criminal Investigation and Intelligence Department for proper investigation and prosecution.
