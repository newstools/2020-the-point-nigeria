…predicts more serious crisis in APC, PDP A cleric, Prophet Sunday Iyunade, has warned that the outbreak of another virus deadlier than Coronavirus is imminent unless Nigerians pray hard to God to avert. Iyunade, who is the president of Pentecostal Sanctuary Bible Ministries, Ijebu Ode, Ogun State, also predicted that the ruling All Progressives Party and main opposition Peoples Democratic Party would soon experience “divine shaking” to pave way for a new breed of politicians in Nigeria. He urged Nigerians to pray ceaselessly for their political leaders, warning that some of them might suffer mysterious death. “None of those politicians positioning themselves for 2023 presidency would ever be there as the Almighty God is committed to raising a new crop of leaders that would run the affairs of the country,” he said. The cleric spoke while addressing reporters on the church’s forthcoming 24th anniversary and 18th Annual Convention of the church with the theme, “Maranatha,” scheduled for between March 22 and29. He scored the President Muhammadu Buhari administration’s handling of the affairs low, saying, “The President has no such divine approval or backing to do more than whatever he has done in the last four years.” But Iyunade encouraged Nigerians to be cheerful, adding that God would raise a new set of leaders that would move the country forward. He also appealed to the residents of Ogun State to exercise patience with the Governor Dapo Abiodun administration, saying that it had a brighter prospect. The cleric, however, urged the governor to focus on repairing the bad roads across the state and improving other infrastructure. “The status of many roads in the state to say the least is an eyesore,” he said.
