Ogun State Governor, Dapo Abiodun, has converted one of the multi-billion naira model colleges constructed by his predecessor, Senator Ibikunle Amosun, into an isolation centre for treatment of coronavirus patients. The abandoned structure, located in Ikenne, in Ikenne Local Government Area, was named after late HID Awolowo, wife of the late sage, Chief Obafemi Awolowo. With this, Ogun now boasts of three isolation centres: the first centre is located at Olabisi Onabanjo University Teaching Hospital (OOUTH), another at Iberekodo in Abeokuta and the new one at Ikenne. Meanwhile, the state government has aligned with President Muhammad Buhari’s directive concerning the restriction of movement within and outside its boundaries. A statement by the Chief Press Secretary to the Governor, Kunle Somorin, said, “Consequently, movement is restricted within and across our borders with neighbouring states and the international border with the Republic of Benin, effective from 11pm on Monday. “The only exceptions to this restriction are as announced by the President. “The general public is, once again, enjoined to comply with this directive in the overall interest of all.”
