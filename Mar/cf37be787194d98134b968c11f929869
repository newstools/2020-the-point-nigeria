Minister of Finance, Budget and National Planning, Mrs. Zainab Ahmed, and the Central Bank of Nigeria Governor, Mr Godwin Emefiele, have said that the financial sector will continue to perform skeletal services during the two weeks restrictions placed on movement by the Federal Government. They said this in a statement jointly signed by them and made available to journalists in Abuja. The statement said that exemptions have been obtained from the President to allow very skeletal operations in the financial system and money markets. This, it said, was needed to keep the system in light operations during this time. To this end, the statement said all relevant staff of affected outfits and agencies should look out for further instructions from their immediate bosses. It stated, “To ensure that Nigerians can still perform online transactions and use ATMs whilst observing these restrictions, we will like to inform the general public and all affected stakeholders that we have obtained exemptions from the President to allow very skeletal operations in the Financial System and Money Markets in order to keep the system in light operations during this time. “We are mindful of the difficulties these restrictions would bring on ordinary Nigerians and are grateful to the President for approving these exemptions, which should help ease some of these burdens. “We urge all Nigerians to be patient, cooperative and united as all hands are on deck to defeat this virus.” The statement said the restrictions are critical to significantly reduce the transmission rate of the disease and make it much easier for the health professionals to trace, test and isolate patients.
