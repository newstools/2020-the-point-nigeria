The Joint Admission and Matriculation Board, on Wednesday, announced a new method of checking the 2020 Unified Tertiary Matriculation Examination after it shut down its portal. JAMB stated that it came up with the new method of checking UTME results due to the activities of fraudsters. The Board advised candidates to check their results by using their unique telephone numbers. The examination body said in a tweet, “JAMB has not cancelled the results of its examination conducted on Saturday, March 14, Monday, March 16 and Tuesday, March 17, 2020. “Therefore, candidates should disregard rumours making the rounds that the results have been cancelled. “To check their results, candidates are to send ‘RESULT’ to 55019 with their unique phone number and not on the Board’s website.” Reports that candidates who took the UTME on Monday couldn’t access their results earlier circulated, fueling speculations that the Board might have cancelled the results. Before the Board introduced the new method, candidates were accessing their results on the JAMB portal or their profile pages.
