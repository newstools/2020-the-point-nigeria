The Kano State House of Assembly on Monday suspended five of its members for six months in connection with last week’s fracas in the Assembly over alleged attempt to remove former emir Muhammadu Sanusi II. Announcing the suspension of the members at the resumption of the Assembly’s sitting, Speaker Abdulazeez Gafasa said the members were suspended for alleged misconduct and violation of the rules of the House. The suspended lawmakers include Garba Ya’u Gwarmai representing Kunchi/Tsanyawa constituency, Labaran Abdul Madari representing Warawa constituency, Isyaku Ali Danja representing Gezawa constituency, Mohammed Bello representing Rimingado/Tofa constituency and Salisu Ahmed Gwangwazo representing Kano Municipal, respectively. Gafasa said, “The five members are suspended for violating the rules of the House especially Order IV Sub 4 a, b, d and e. “They behaved violently and even attempted to snatch away the mace in a clear attempt to sabotage the sitting of the House.” Some members of the Assembly had reportedly disrupted last Monday’s sitting over alleged plans to remove the former Emir. The sitting was disrupted when a committee saddled with the responsibility to investigate Sanusi was about to submit its report to the House. The committee’s report was said to have recommended his dethronement.
