The Supreme Court has dismissed the application for review of its January 14, 2020 judgment that sacked Emeka Ihedioha as Imo State Governor, and declared Hope Uzodinma as the valid winner of the last governorship election in the state. The apex court said on Tuesday that the Ihediohaâ€™s application for review of the judgment lacked merit. A seven-man panel of the Supreme Court led by the Chief Justice of Nigeria, Justice Tanko Muhammad, in a split ruling of six-to-one, described the application by Ihedioha as an invitation to sit in an appeal over its judgment.
