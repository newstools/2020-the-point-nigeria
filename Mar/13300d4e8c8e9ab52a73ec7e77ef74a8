The Federal Government on Friday announced that four stadia in the country will be used as isolation centres in the fight against coronavirus pandemic. It also said all National Youth Service Corps orientation camps in the country would be used as isolation centres. Minister of Youth and Sports, Sunday Dare, disclosed this via his Twitter handle. He tweeted, “Mr. President has approved for the Ministry of Youth and Sports to open and make available the stadiums in Surulere Lagos, Ibadan, Abuja, and Kaduna, as well as our NYSC camps nationwide for use as isolation centers as they are needed. We are in touch with relevant authorities.” As of 12:00 pm on Friday, the Nigeria Centre for Disease Control said there are 65 cases of coronavirus in the country aside from a number of suspected cases. The Federal Government had on March 18 ordered the immediate closure of NYSC orientation camps nationwide over coronavirus fears. But Dare said President Muhammadu Buhari approved the re-opening of the camps as COVID-19 isolation centres.
