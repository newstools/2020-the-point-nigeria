Minister of Health, Dr. Osagie Ehanire, has said that the Director-General of the Nigeria Centre for Disease Control, Chikwe Ihekweazu, has been quarantined for 14 days. Ehanire disclosed this on Tuesday when he appeared before the Senate leadership to provide an update on the activities of his ministry to curb the spread of coronavirus in the country. He told the Senate principal officers that Ihekweazu was quarantined because he just returned from China. He said the standard practice was for anyone coming into Nigeria to be quarantined for 14 days before mingling with other members of the public.
