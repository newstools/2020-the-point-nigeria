Operatives of the Special Anti-Robbery Squad in Lagos have arrested a notorious suspect simply identified as Oloja. Before his arrest by SARS, Oloja had been on the wanted list of the police in the state. The suspect is said to be the leader of suspected cultists terrorising several communities in Lagos. Findings by our correspondent showed that Oloja and his accomplices had wasted several lives around Ilupeju, Palmgrove, Onipanu, Fadeyi and others. Residents of the community confirmed that the SARS team was led by Muhammed Akeek, who is popularly called Skoda. According to them, Skoda who had left Mushin Division, deliberately returned to lead the manhunt for Oloja. It was also learnt that Skoda and his team had allegedly killed one Francis Idum, an office cleaner, during the team’s operations in the area some time last year. Speaking on the arrest of the suspect, a resident of the area, Babalola Olalekan, said, “We thank God they have arrested the leader of the cultists terrorising our area. Several lives have been wasted by these people and because of them, people are now scared of our community. I want the police to intensify efforts to get the other culprits too arrested.” When contacted, the Lagos Police Public Relations Officer, Bala Elkanah, said investigation into the matter was still ongoing.
