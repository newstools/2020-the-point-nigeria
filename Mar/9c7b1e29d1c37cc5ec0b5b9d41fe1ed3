The police in Borno State have arrested one of its officers, Abubakar Musa, for allegedly defiling two minors aged 10 and 12 years in his neighbourhood.  The mother and guardian of the two victims of rape, Ms. Hadiza Saidu, alleged that the police inspector had continuously raped the two girls whenever he found them alone at home.  She further explained that police personnel at Metro Police Station, where she reported the incident, were pleading with her to forget the matter to save the job of the randy police officer.  She added that the accused officer had been sending emissaries to beg her not to take the matter up.  Saidu said, “His name is Abubakar Musa. He used to sneak into our house, whenever none of us was around to sexually abuse the children. According to the kids, he used to finger one of them while directly having sexual intercourse with the other one. We took the matter to Metro Police Station and his colleagues called me aside to beg me that I should let the matter die for the sake of his job. I asked why they were not concerned about my own kids that have been abused.  “I insist that justice must be done to my daughter and her little cousin, who is the daughter of my younger sister. If he is not guilty, there is no way he would be begging us to save his job and sending people to beg us.”  However, the Executive Director of Women in the New Nigeria and Youth Empowerment Initiative, Lucy Yunana, said her organisation was already monitoring the case.
