No fewer than 20 police vans have been mounted at the entrance of the All Progressive Congress’ secretariat in Wuse 2, Abuja. From the entrance of the Blantyre Street location of the APC secretariat, police vans were strategically positioned down to the end of it. The reason for the lock-down, it was learnt, was not unconnected with the possible resumption to office by the embattled APC National Chairman, Adams Oshiomohle. Staff of the APC secretariat and journalists were also barred from entering the building by policemen and other security agents mounting guard at the entrance. An FCT High Court in Jabi, Abuja, had on Wednesday suspended Oshiomhole as the national chairman of the All Progressives Congress. Justice Danlami Senchi, who ordered the suspension, also asked Oshiomhole to stop parading himself as the chairman of the party, pending the determination of the substantive suit seeking his perpetual removal as the national chairman. The appeal by Oshiomhole against the ruling of an FCT High Court, which suspended him from office has not been fixed for hearing. In a Notice of Appeal No: FCT/HC/CV/837/2020 filed on Wednesday before the Court of Appeal in Abuja, Oshiomhole asked the appellate court to allow the appeal and set aside the ruling of the high court delivered on March 4. Meanwhile a Federal High Court in Kano has restrained the Independent National Electoral Commission (INEC) from recognising any other person aside Adams Oshiomhole as the national chairman of the APC. Justice A. Lewis-Allagoa gave the ex-parte order on Thursday following Wednesday’s ruling of an FCT High Court in Jabi, Abuja. Justice Lewis-Allagoa’s order followed an ex-parte motion filed by one Aliyu Muhammad Rabiu and argued on his behalf by his counsel, Johnmary Chukwukasi Jideobi, before the Kano court.
