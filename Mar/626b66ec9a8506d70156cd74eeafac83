…blasts musician, urges govt to caution him  A child rights activist, Oluwadamisi Tayo-Ladega, has called on government to caution pop star, Naira Marley, over the negative influence his campaign is having on teenagers.  Tayo-Ladega, who is the founder of a non-governmental organisation, His Marvelous Grace Support Foundation, said several minors ignorant about Marley’s campaigns were being corrupted on a daily basis.  She stressed further that government and other authorities that care about the lives of the future leaders should spring into action to stop the musician from polluting the future leaders of Nigeria.  Tayo-Ladega said, “I am indeed worried about the trend at which Naira Marley issue is being managed by the authorities. This is a guy who keeps polluting our children and yet people are not saying anything. These are our future leaders. They are our future. Should we leave them to someone to destroy them for us because he wants to make some unclean wealth? Anywhere you go now, you will see the children, teenagers misbehaving while calling themselves Marlians. I learnt some of them are now cultists calling themselves Marlians. This guy who is supposed to be a role model and preach good moral in the society keeps polluting our children and yet he is not cautioned.  “I think it is time the government and other authorities that cater for these kids should rise and let us caution this young man. We are not saying he should not sing, but he should stop corrupting our children. Most of them don’t know the implications of what they are doing until future.”  She also called on parents across the country to be good managers of their children and wards.  According to her, parents should not be too busy to groom their children properly, saying that putting the children behind work and others would allow characters like Marley to influence them negatively.
