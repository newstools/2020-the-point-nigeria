The US Food and Drug Administration has issued an emergency use authorisation for chloroquine and hydroxychloroquine to treat patients hospitalised with Covid-19, reports CNN. The drugs — which are used to treat malaria and other conditions — have been called game changers by President Donald Trump. The drugs are used to treat malaria and other conditions, and  there is little scientific evidence that chloroquine, or its closely-related analogue hydroxychloroquine, are effective in treating Covid-19. CNN reported that the authorisation came in a letter dated Saturday, but the US Department of Health and Human Services acknowledged the FDA’s action in a Sunday news release. The FDA limited the scope of its authorisation to drugs supplied from the Strategic National Stockpile. The HHS announced that two pharmaceutical companies — Bayer and a division of Novartis — had donated the drugs to the stockpile. “Anecdotal reports suggest that these drugs may offer some benefit in the treatment of hospitalized COVID-19 patients. “The safety profile of these drugs has only been studied for FDA approved indications, not COVID-19,” HSS said in a statement While there’s limited evidence on the efficacy of chloroquine, or hydroxychloroquine, the FDA said the drugs’ benefits outweighed their risk. In its letter, the FDA encouraged randomised clinical trials that could assess the effectiveness of the drugs. It also noted that the known and potential benefits outweigh the risks. The authorisation is limited to patients who are currently hospitalised and weigh at least 50kg, or about 110 pounds. Under the emergency use authorisation, health care providers must contact their local or state health department to access the drugs.
