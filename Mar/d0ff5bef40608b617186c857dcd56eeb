The Special Adviser to Governor Abdullahi Ganduje on Media, Salihu Yakasai, said on Tuesday that the deposed Emir of Kano, Muhammad Sanusi II, refused to leave the palace after he was dethroned. He said Sanusi remained adamant even after he had been formally informed of his dethronement on Monday. Yakasai, who spoke on Channels Television’s Sunrise Daily programme, said the state government had to deploy policemen to eject and escort him out. He said if Sanusi had humbled himself and left the palace immediately he was informed of his removal, he would have been spared the drama. According to Yakasai, “They wanted it to be a quiet thing. That is the standard, the law. A deposed emir has to leave the state as it was done in the past but I don’t know what happened in the palace that caused the delay. “At the initial stage, the emir wasn’t willing to leave the palace and that was why you saw what we saw with the security forces and what have you. “If he had left willingly, I don’t think you would have seen such a reaction from the security apparatus. “The situation, though intense, wasn’t for long and as you can see Kano is peaceful.”
