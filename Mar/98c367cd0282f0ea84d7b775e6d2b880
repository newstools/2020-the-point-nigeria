 A former Commissioner of Youth and Sports in Ogun State, Bukola Olopade, has tested positive for coronavirus. Olopade had, about two days ago, said he was awaiting the result of his test, disclosing that he had been in isolation since he realised that he had symptoms of the deadly virus. In a video he posted on Thursday, the former commisisoner said he had finally tested positive, but was hopeful of recovering very fast. He reminded Nigerians that testing positive for COVID-19 was not a death sentence, adding that he had started packing his bag to go for medical attention. Olopade said, “A few days ago, I did make a video, where I said that I had been tested for COVID-19 and expecting the result. I did promise to make this public once that was done. And it has come back now, just a couple of hours ago, that I tested positive for COVID-19. “As you all know, it’s not a death sentence. It’s not the end of the world. I feel no symptoms, I feel great, I feel very healthy. But I’ve been called in. So I’ve packed my stuffs, ready to go in for observation. Hopefully, in a few days, I’ll come out, by the special grace of God, with a clean bill of health, and once more, endeavour to inform the public. “But please remember, stick to all the advice given by government, and all health bodies, World Health Organisation. Please stay at home, do your social distancing, wash your hands. This is no respecter of anybody or any borders. Thank you for all your prayers, all your well wishes. I’ll see you on a rebound.” Nigeria has recorded 14 new Coronavirus cases, according to official statistics, with total number of cases now standing at 65.
