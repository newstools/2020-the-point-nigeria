The deposed Emir of Kano, Muhammadu Sanusi II, was on Tuesday relocated from Loko to Awe, a farther part of Nasarawa State. Sanusi was dethroned on Monday by the Kano State Government, which banished him first to Loko in Nasarawa State. The deposed monarch was immediately arrested by security agents, who first whisked him away to Loko, about 200 kilometres away from Lafia, the Nasarawa State capital. But on Tuesday, Sanusi was again relocated. He was flown in a helicopter from his former Loko asylum to another location in Awe, within the same Nasarawa State, but about four hours drive away.
