Wife of the President, Mrs. Aisha Buhari, has closed her office for two weeks after some of her workers returned from a trip to the United Kingdom. She also said her daughter, who returned from the United Kingdom, had been in self-isolation. Mrs. Buhari, who tweeted the developments through her personal handle, @aishambuhari, said she acted based on the advice of the Minister of Health and the Presidential Task Force on COVID-19. She tweeted, “Good afternoon Nigerians, earlier today (Thursday) my daughter returned from the UK being among the high-burden listed countries of COVID-19. “Based on the advice of the Hon. Minister Of Health, Presidential Task Force on COVID-19 and that of NCDC, She is on self-isolation, not because she displayed any symptoms of the COVID-19. “Please, I urge all parents to do the same if possible, as prevention is better than cure.
