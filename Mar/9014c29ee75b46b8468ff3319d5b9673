Embattled National Chairman of the All Progressives Congress, Adams Oshiomhole, has said that a serving minister and some governors are responsible for his current travails in the party. Oshiomhole, however, did not name the minister and the governors. He spoke shortly after meeting President Muhammadu Buhari at the Presidential Villa, Abuja on Thursday. Oshiomhole met with Buhari behind closed doors as news broke that Justice Lewis Allagoa of the Federal High Court in Kano, had set aside a ruling of the FCT High Court suspending him as the APC national chairman. He said he came specifically to brief Buhari on developments in the party, being the national leader.
