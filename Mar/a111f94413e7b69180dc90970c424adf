The police in Lagos have arrested a 70-year-old man, Baba Bashua, for forcibly having carnal knowledge of a challenged lady.  It was gathered that the suspect, who resides in the Agbede Oloshugbo, Agric Isawo, Ikorodu area of Lagos, forcibly had sex with the challenged lady after luring her into his house.  Credible sources confirmed that the septuagenarian had once been accused of defiling a minor in the area, but community elders settled the matter, saying he was not caught in the act.  A resident of the area, Ademola Shittu, said, “That man should be well investigated. He has once been accused of raping a little girl two years ago. Now, he is also involved in raping an imbecile. I think the matter needs to be thoroughly investigated and I believe the elders in this area will not come out again if they don’t want to disgrace themselves. At first, when this old man was accused, the elders came out and settled the matter, saying he was not caught in the act, but now that there is a witness, I think they should just send him to jail.”  Another resident, who simply identified himself as Oriyomi, said, “He lured the imbecile girl into his room and forcefully sleep with her. He was caught by a neighbour, who raised the alarm to the parents of the girl. He later confessed to the crime and begged for forgiveness but the law has to take its cause.”  Meanwhile, a child rights advocate, Comrade Lateef Akinborode, who confirmed the incident, said, “The matter is going to court. I heard that the family of the suspect is trying to settle the victim’s family with money, but this will not happen. The suspect has to face the law for his action.”  The Lagos State Police Public Relations Officer, Bala Elkanah, said the matter was already under police investigation.  He added that the suspect would face the wrath of the law, if found guilty.
