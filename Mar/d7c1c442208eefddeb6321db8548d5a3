 The Chief of Staff to President Muhammadu Buhari, Abba Kyari, has tested positive for Coronavirus. Kyari reportedly possibly contracted the virus during a visit to Germany and Egypt for a meeting on the Nigerian Electricity Regulation Commission. The commissionâ€™s Executive Chairman, Prof. James Momoh, also attended the meeting. Kyari attended many meetings after his return from the trips last week. The CoS was said to have started coughing during a meeting on Sunday at the Aso Rock Villa, fuelling speculation he could have the virus. His test result, which came in on Tuesday morning, confirmed him positive. President Muhammadu Buhari, who also had to take the test, however, is negative.
