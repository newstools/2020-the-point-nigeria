â€¦orders police, DSS to provide him security A Federal High Court sitting in Kano has set aside a ruling of the FCT High Court suspending the National Chairman of the All Progressives Congress, Adams Oshiomhole. Justice Lewis Alagoa on Thursday ordered that the status quo ante Bellum be maintained. He, however, added that pending the hearing of the motion on notice by the applicant, Aliyu Muhammad Rabiu, the defendants (the APC, Oshiomhole, IG of Police, INEC and DG, DSS) should not give effect to the purported resolution of Ward 10, Etsako Local Government Area, which suspended Oshiomhole.
