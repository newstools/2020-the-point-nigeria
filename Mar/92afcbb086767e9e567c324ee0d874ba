The police in Lagos have arrested a food seller, simply identified as Iya Sarah, for allegedly pouring a pot of hot beans on a 10-year-old boy, Ibrahim Ayinde.  Eyewitnesses reported that Iya Sarah allegedly committed the crime following a complaint by the boy that the food she sold to him was “too small” for the money collected from him.  Our correspondent gathered that the incident occurred when Ibrahim was sent on an errand by his boss, James Busari, to buy beans for him from Iya Sarah at 13 Olumo Street, Onike. The boy, who was said to have noticed that the food sold to him was not commensurate with the price he paid, complained to Iya Sarah, who then scooped some hot beans from the pot on fire and poured it on the boy’s back.  A resident of the community, Babalola Saheed, who confirmed the incident, said, “The food seller over- reacted to the boy’s complaint. The boy may complain so that his boss will not beat him for buying such a small quantity of food. It was expected of her to either return his money or explain things to him. Such an action was cruel on her part.”  Another resident, who spoke under anonymity, said, “The woman should pay for her sin. I was aware of the matter and I wish she could pay for her sin. She is full of unruly behaviours. People complain about her a lot. She is fond of treating her customers badly.  But a child rights activist, Mr. Ebenezer Omejalile, said efforts would be made to ensure that the beans seller paid for her sins.  “We are on the matter; she has to explain her action in court. What she did was uncalled for, not even to such a minor,” Omejalile said.  Lagos State Police Public Relations Officer, Bala Elkana, could not be reached as at press time.
