The Director-General of the Progressives Governors’ Forum, Salihu Lukman, on Friday, urged President Muhammadu Buhari to intervene in the current crisis rocking the ruling All Progressives Congress. Lukman said President Buhari, in conjunction with the party’s National Working Committee should liaise with APC governors and the national caucus, to convene a National Executive Council meeting to appoint an acting National Chairman for the party. He said in a statement in Abuja that this would provide a window of opportunity for the party to rebuild and restore confidence. The PGF is the umbrella body of governors elected on the platform of the APC. According to Lukman, “Combinations of a majority of the remaining members of the NWC in consultation with President Buhari, Governors, other party leaders who are leading members of the National Caucus can resolve all these issues and convene the NEC to appoint an Acting National Chairman. “With the appointment of an Acting National Chairman, the next would be to seek to invoke provisions of Article 25 A(i) of the APC constitution, which stipulate that the National Convention of the Party shall be held once in two years at a date, venue and time to be recommended by the National Working Committee and approved by the National Executive Committee subject to the giving of statutory notice to Independent National Electoral Commission and at least 14 days’ notice given to members eligible to attend.”
