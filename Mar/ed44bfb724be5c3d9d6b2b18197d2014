A twenty nine-year-old man, Adeyele Sesan, has been remanded in a Nigeria Correctional Centre by an Ifetedo Magistrate’s Court in Osun State for allegedly defiling a three-year-old girl.  Sesan was said to have been having a sexual relationship with the victim’s mother before he forcibly had carnal knowledge of the toddler after her mother left with him to go and fetch something elsewhere.  Police prosecution counsel, Inspector Sunday Osanyintuyi, told the court that the defendant committed the offence on February 18, 2020 at about 11 a.m. in Ifetedo, Osun State.  Osanyintuyi alleged that the defendant defiled the 3-year-old girl.  The prosecution also said the defendant attempted to kill the three-year-old girl by covering up her mouth with his hand while raping her.  He argued that the offence contravened the provisions of Sections 3(1), (2)s of the Child Rights Laws of Osun, 2007 and Sections 320 (1), 355 and 360 of the Criminal Code Laws of Osun State, 2002.  The defendant, however, pleaded not guilty.  Magistrate Joseph Owolabi refused the oral bail application filed by the defendant’s counsel, Mr. Yomi Ogunlola, and ordered the defence to file formal application for bail.  Owolabi also ordered the prosecution to duplicate the case file for the office of the director of public prosecution.  He adjourned the matter till March 25 for hearing.
