The Nigeria Labour Congress, on Tuesday, condemned and totally rejected any plan to inflict further pains on Nigerians by the Nigerian Electricity Regulatory Commission. NLC President, Comrade Ayuba Wabba, in a statement, said that such action would only add more pains to Nigerians as the country tackles the dreaded coronavirus disease. Wabba lamented that while other countries are battling the COVID-19 pandemic and expanding social welfare and putting in place economic stimulus, including distribution of free foods, free healthcare services, sanitary kits, utility bills reduction, debt moratorium, and cash support to insulate their citizens from the harsh realities of the fight against the novel coronavirus, “our own case in Nigeria cannot be different.” He further noted that “the concerns in the public domain are not helped by reports that the NERC has not issued any reversal order to Electricity Distribution Companies (DISCOs) on the planned tariff increase in power utility. “The leaders of our affiliate unions were unanimous in rejecting the planned increase in electricity tariff during our recent interactive session with NERC in Kano. “Any increase in electricity tariff would only convey a deafening expression of insensitivity to the plight of the Nigerian people who are currently dealing with the social scare, income hemorrhage, economic squeeze and mortal dread of COVID-19.” He noted that this is the right time to show Nigerians that their lives matters. “If there is any time to show that the very essence of government is the security and welfare of citizens, it is now.” While he noted that Nigerian workers find tremendous succour in the altruism shared by President Muhammadu Buhari in his address, he said, “we urge the Nigerian Electricity Regulatory Commission not to embark on any fruitless adventure that would cast aspersion on the good intentions of Mr. President.”
