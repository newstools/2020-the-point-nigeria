A Chief Magistrateâ€™s Court sitting in Makurdi, Benue State, has sentenced a Fulani herder, Muhammad Abdullahi, to one-year imprisonment. The convict, who is from Mahanga village in Awe Local Government Area of Nassarawa State, was convicted for violating the Benue State Open Grazing Prohibition and Ranches Establishment Law 2017. Police prosecutor, ASP Gbakor Hyacinth, had earlier told the Court that the State Commander of the Livestock Guards, Linus Zaki, and his team arrested the accused on March 2 at about 07:30 pm along Guma Village, Guma Local Government Area, with cows grazing openly, an offence contrary to Section 19(2) of Open Grazing Prohibition and Ranches Establishment Law 2017 of the state. Abdullahi pleaded guilty after the charges were read and interpreted to him in Hausa Language. But counsel to the accused, T.I. Ikyagba, pleaded for leniency on behalf of his client. He said that the accused was a first-time offender, who did not waste the time of the court, having immediately accepted that he committed the offence. The presiding judge, Isaac Ajim, in his judgment, after listening to the plea for leniency, sentenced the accused to one-year imprisonment. He, however, gave him with an option of a N500, 000 fine.
