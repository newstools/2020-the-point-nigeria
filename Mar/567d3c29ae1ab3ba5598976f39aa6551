The police in Ogun have arrested a secondary school teacher, Azunyere Chima, for having unlawful carnal knowledge of his 14-year-old student (names withheld). The 23-year-old teacher was apprehended following a report by the father of the victim at the Ibafo Divisional Headquarters that his daughter was lured to the house of the suspect, who happened to be her ART teacher under the pretence that he wanted to help her on her practical work. But the state Police Public Relations Officer, Abimbola Oyeyemi, said in a statement that when the teenager got to the teacherâ€™s house, he dragged her into his room, over powered and forcibly had sex with her as a result of which the victim bled seriously from her private part. Upon the report, the DPO Ibafo, Superintendent Abiodun Ayinde, detailed his detectives to the residence of the suspect at Aseese, where he was promptly arrested. Oyeyemi said that the suspect had since made a confessional statement to the police, while the victim had been taken to a hospital for medical treatment. He added that the Commissioner of Police, Kenneth Ebrimson, had directed that the suspect be transferred to anti-human trafficking and child labour unit of the State Criminal Investigation and Intelligence Department for proper investigation and prosecution.
