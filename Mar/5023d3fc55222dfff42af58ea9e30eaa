The former Emir of Kano, Lamido Sanusi, on Thursday instituted a suit at the Federal High Court in Abuja seeking an order for his release from the post-dethronement detention and confinement. Sanusi was on Monday dethroned by the Kano State Government and banished, first to Loko and later to Awe in Nasarawa State, where he’s being detained in an apartment in the town. The deposed Emir’s legal team led by Lateef Fagbemi (SAN) filed the suit marked FHC/ABJ/CS/357/2020 before the Federal High Court in Abuja. He’s praying for an interim order releasing him “from the detention and or confinement of the respondents and restoring the applicant’s rights to human dignity, personal liberty, freedom of association and movement in Nigeria, (apart from Kano State) pending the hearing and determination of the applicant’s originating summons.” Respondents to the application are the Inspector-General of Police, the Director-General of the Department of State Service, the Attorney-General of Kano State and the Attorney-General of the Federation.
