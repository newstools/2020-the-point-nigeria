Acting National Secretary of the All Progressives Congress, Victor Giadom, said on Wednesday that the party will respect the order of the court suspending the National Chairman, Adams Oshiomhole, from office. Giadom said as a law-abiding political party, the APC had no other choice than to respect the decision of the court on Oshimhole. The APC acting national secretary addressed reporters amid heavy security presence at the partyâ€™s National Secretariat in Abuja. No fewer than 13 patrol vans loaded with armed policemen were observed around the APC National Secretariat.
