The Senate has approved the $22.7billion loan request by President Muhammadu Buhari, after a heated debate that ended up in a closed session. The lawmakers, on Thursday, after a 45-minute closed-door session, approved the two-item recommendation of the Senator Clifford Ordia-led Committee on Local and Foreign Loans. It was gathered that the senators, at the closed door session, had resolved the issues that had generated tension during the initial deliberation on the document. Senate President Ahmed Lawan pledged that the loan would be spent on projects that would have an impact on the lives of Nigerians. Lawan also challenged the various Senate committees to ensure strict oversight so that every dollar in the loan would be accounted for. The loan is expected to come from international financial organisations, including the Islamic Development Bank, African Development Bank, the World Bank and banks from China, Japan and Germany.
