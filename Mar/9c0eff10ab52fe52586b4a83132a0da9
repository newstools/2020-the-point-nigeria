Lagos State Governor, Babajide Sanwo-Olu, said on Friday that curfew may be imposed in the state with the increasing cases of coronavirus. He said this during a live broadcast at the State House, Marina. He said, “We are moving to the direction of curfew, but there are indices and numbers we need to see, we haven’t seen that number yet to warrant a curfew. “The disease is not a respecter of anybody. It doesn’t look at class, gender or race, everybody is at risk; that is why we need to obey the rules and regulations set for ourselves.” The Nigeria Centre for Disease Control on Thursday said the cases of the coronavirus in the country had increased to 65 – three have been discharged and one dead. Currently, the majority of cases were imported to the country from high-risk nations such as the United States, the United Kingdom, and other European countries. Among top officials who have tested positive are the Chief of Staff to the President, Abba Kyari, and the Bauchi State Governor, Bala Mohammed. The disease has spread to eight states and the Federal Capital Territory. There are 44 cases in Lagos; 12 in the Federal Capital Territory; Ogun State, three; Ekiti State, one; Bauchi State, two; Oyo State, one; Edo State, one; Osun State, one and Rivers State, one.
