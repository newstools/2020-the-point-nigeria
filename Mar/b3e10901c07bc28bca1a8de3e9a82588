Suspected gunmen have abducted the mother of the Chairman of Yenagoa Local Government Area of Bayelsa State, Mr. Uroupaye Nimizuoa. The state Police Command confirmed the kidnapping of the 80-year-old Mrs. Beauty Nimizuoa in a statement on Friday in Yenagoa. The spokesman for the command, Mr. Asinim Butswat, said the octogenarian was abducted by five assailants at her Agudama-Ekpetiama country home at 11:45 pm on Thursday. Butswat said the hoodlums took her away “in a pathfinder jeep without a registration number plate.” He said the bandits later abandoned the vehicle and “escaped into the creek.” “The command has launched a manhunt for the kidnappers, and to rescue the victim. An investigation is ongoing,” Butswat said.
