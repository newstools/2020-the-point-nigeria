The National Working Committee of the All Progressives Congress has lifted the suspension on the party’s Deputy National Chairman (North), Sen. Lawal Shuaibu, and National Vice Chairman North, Inuwa Abdulkadir. APC National Chairman, Adams Oshiomhole, announced this after the party’s NWC meeting in Abuja, on Wednesday. Oshiomhole said, “In the spirit of reconciliation, the NWC sat and reviewed the case of the Deputy National Chairman (North), Senator Lawal Shuaibu, and areas where we felt he offended the system, which led to the suspension and decided in the new spirit to lift the suspension. “In the same spirit also, we reviewed the case of the National Vice Chairman North, Inuwa Abdulkadir, who was suspended and we have also lifted it. I am sure that with what we have done the opposition will be disappointed.”
