The Nigerian Civil Aviation Authority has restricted all international flights into the country to the Murtala Muhammed International Airport, Lagos and the Nnamdi Azikiwe International Airport, Abuja. NCAA Director-General, Capt. Musa Nuhu, in a March 19 letter to airline operators, said the directive was as a result of the Federal Government’s travel ban on 13 countries. Nuhu said the directive would take effect from 12am on Saturday, March 21. He stated that the Mallam Aminu Kano International Airport, Kano; Akanu Ibiam International Airport, Enugu and Port Harcourt International Airport, Omagwa, would be closed to all international flights. The NCAA boss also said that all persons arriving in Nigeria who might have visited the countries affected by the travel ban 15 days before their arrival, would be subjected to supervised self-quarantine and testing for 14 days. According to him, “The travel restriction is applicable to all flight crew from the affected countries. “All operators wishing to operate into Nigeria are required to operate with two sets of flight crew; one set to operate into Nigeria and one set to operate out of Nigeria.”
