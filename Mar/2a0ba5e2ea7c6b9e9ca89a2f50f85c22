Police in Osun State have dragged three aged women before an Osogbo Magistrate’s Court for allegedly defrauding a man, Saraki Adeoti, to the tune of N300,000.  The defendants; Jimoh Wulemotu, aged 70; Lasisi Falilatu, 60, and Yisa Abibatu, all of the same family, were accused of conspiring and duping Adeoti on August 22, 2016 at Okiki’s Compound in Isale-Osun, Osogbo.  Police prosecutor, Olayiwola Rasaq informed the court that the three grannies fraudulently obtained N300,000 from Adeoti with a pretence to sell a six-bedroom uncompleted building to him.  Rasaq argued that the accused persons denied Adeoti access to the said building after collecting the money. The prosecutor accused the women of intent to steal from the complainant.  He said they committed an offence contrary to and punishable under Sections 516, 419, 390 (9) and 421 of the Criminal Code, Cap 34, Vol 11, Laws of Osun State of Nigeria, 2002.  The accused persons, who said they were traders, pleaded not guilty to the four count-charge brought against them.  Their counsel, A. O. Olodo, applied for their bail and informed the court that they had been visiting the police station since the matter was reported.  But the complainant’s lawyer, Sunday Atofarati, urged the court to warn the defendants against threatening to kill Adeoti.  He also asked the court to order that no one should visit the building in contest until the final determination of the case.  Magistrate T. Badmus granted the grandmothers bail in the sum of 100,000 with one surety each in like sum.  He said the surety must be a blood relation and must be gainfully employed.  The case was adjourned till March 31 for hearing.
