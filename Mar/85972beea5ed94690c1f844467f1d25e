Bauchi State Governor, Bala Mohammed, said on Monday that he met and shook hands with Mohammed, the son of former Vice-President of Nigeria, Atiku Abubakar, who tested positive for COVID-19 on Sunday. The governor said in a statement by his Senior Special Assistant on Media, Mukhtar Gidado, that he met Atiku’s son on an Aero Contractors’ flight recently. He, therefore, stated that he had gone into self-isolation in line with the directive of the Nigerian Centre for Disease Control. The statement read in part, “This is to inform the general public that his Excellency, Bala Mohammed, has gone into self-isolation. “This development is sequel to a report from the NCDC that the son of former VP of Nigeria was tested negative for the coronavirus upon his return from an international trip through Lagos. “It would be recalled that Governor Bala Mohammed, who also recently returned from, an official trip in Lagos, met with Mohammed Atiku Abubakar in the Aero Contractor aircraft where they shook hands and exchanged pleasantries. “So far, the governor has not exhibited any symptom of the disease but based on the recommendation of the NCDC, he will remain indoors to avoid the risk of spreading the disease. Currently, the blood sample of the governor is being taken and is undergoing clinical test.”
