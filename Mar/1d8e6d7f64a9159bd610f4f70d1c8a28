 Federal High Court in Abuja has ordered the release of the dethroned Emir of Kano, Muhammadu Sanusi II, from detention in Nasarawa State. Sanusi was banished to Awe, a town in Nasarawa State, after the Kano State Government dethroned him on Monday. But on Friday, Justice Anwuli Chikere granted the interim order for the deposed monarch’s release following an ex parte application moved by his lead counsel, Lateef Fagbemi (SAN). The judge also ordered that the order for Sanusi’s release should be served on the respondents to the application. The respondents to the application are, the Inspector-General of Police, Muhammed Adamu; the Director-General of the Department of State Service, Yusuf Bichi; the Attorney-General of Kano State, Ibrahim Muktar, and the Attorney-General of the Federation, Mr. Abubakar Malami (SAN). The judge fixed March 26 for further hearing in the case.
