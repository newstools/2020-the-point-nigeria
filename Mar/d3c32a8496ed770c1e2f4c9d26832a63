…sends them back to their states of origin The Kaduna State Government has evicted over 20,000 almajiris and sent them back to their states of origin. Commissioner of Human Services and Social Development, Hafsat Baba, who gave the figure said the children and adults have since been sent back to 17 states of the Federation since the operations began two weeks ago. Baba also said that there were foreigners from Republic of Niger among the almajiris. “So far, we have returned over 20,736 almajiris  and adults  to 17 states  and also those from Niger Republic. But we still have clerics that are hiding these children from the authorities at outskirt of the state,” she said. Sheikh Rabiu Abdullahi, the Chairman Tsangaya Schools Association, however, called on all clerics operating such Almajiri schools to shutdown, saying other western schools too have been closed due to the COVID-19 outbreak. “This is why we are urging our members to obey the government by sending the children back home for the time being. We pray God will bring an end to this plaque,” he said. ‎Recall that the state government had few days ago also demolished a popular destitute home along Kano Road within the metropolis. Vehicles were also said to have been provided to some of the beggars, who were stranded, to evacuate them back home as part of measures to curb the ‎spread of the COVID-19 virus in the state. The ministry said the over-congestion in the home was of great concerned to the government, hence the demolition of the house.
