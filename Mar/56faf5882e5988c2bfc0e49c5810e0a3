The crisis rocking the All Progressives Congress worsened on Wednesday, following a court injunction suspending the party’s National Chairman, Adams Oshiomhole, from office. APC National Vice Chairman (North-East), Salihu Mustapha, who backed the court decision, said that following the court injunction, Oshiomhole was for now, in no position to issue any instruction as doing so will be “illegal, null and void.” Mustapha said that his intervention was based on information that as soon as the court pronouncement became public, Oshiomhole allegedly instructed the APC National Publicity Secretary, Mallam Lanre Isa-Onilu to issue a statement announcing Waziri Bulama, as acting National Secretary. Mustapha said, “Immediately the court injunction was given, the national chairman has called the party’s chief press secretary (National Publicity Secretary) to issue a statement to the press that Waziri Bulama is the (acting) National Secretary to the Party. “I believe you are aware of the meeting held about a month ago on that matter, which ended without a decision. Since then there has not been a decision as to the replacement of the secretary. “The chairman is about to create more chaos within the party as he gave the order. “The public should know that any decision that Oshiomhole makes henceforth is an illegal decision and will not hold. “We will keep our fingers crossed until the court decides. I am saying this so that there can be no two acting National Secretaries and there can be no affirmation from a national chairman that has been suspended.” Oshiomhole’s suspension was a sequel to an action instituted by one Olawale Afolabi, who described himself as a member of the party, went to court to stop Oshiomhole from performing the functions of the national chairman. According to him, Oshiomhole ceased to be the APC National Chairman from the day he was suspended by the Edo State Chapter of the party.
