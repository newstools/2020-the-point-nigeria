As part of measures to stop the spread of the Coronavirus outbreak in Plateau State, the government said on Saturday that it had quarantined three Chinese nationals. The Chinese nationals were quarantined in Wase town for suspected case of the virus, authorities said. The state Commissioner for Information, Dan Manjang, disclosed this in an interview. The report noted that the Chinese nationals working in a mining site in Wase, flew into Abuja on Wednesday. Manhang said, “The situation right now is that they have been isolated. The three of them came in through Abuja and once we heard that, the Commissioner for Health had to take a proactive measure to send a medical team to Wase to investigate.” The commissioner was also quoted to have said that the quarantined Chinese nationals made their way to Jos, the Plateau State capital, on Thursday, adding that they were being clinically examined by a medical expert deployed by the state Ministry of Health. But he said there was no confirmed case of the virus in the state, and that people should remain calm. He said, “The problem that we have is that there is a tendency for people to think that investigation or quarantine, as the case may be, means that there is an outbreak of the virus. “As far as Plateau case is concerned, there has been no known case of this virus on the Plateau; we just took proactive measures to make sure that we place them (the Chinese nationals) under investigation and that will take 14 days.” The government, he said, was awaiting the report of the team that was sent to Wase before taking the next step.
