…as FG shuts orientation camps nationwide The National Youth Service Corps, on Wednesday, said that none of its corps members or camp officials had been infected with coronavirus. The NYSC said this just as the Federal Government on Wednesday morning shut all orientation camps nationwide over coronavirus fears. While announcing the closure of the orientation camps across the country, Minister of Youth and Sports Development, Sunday Dare, had said, “Today across the country, NYSC orientation camps will be closed and corps members will be paid and sent to their places of primary assignment.  This again is a precautionary measure on the part of the government to check the spread of COVID-19.” NYSC management in a statement after the minister’s announcement stressed that the decision to shut its camps across the country was essentially out of precaution as none of its officials or corps members had contracted the virus. The statement read, “Sequel to the outbreak of the Coronavirus pandemic which led to the cancellation of the National Sports Festival, the Management of the National Youth Service Corps Scheme wishes to announce the suspension of the on-going Orientation Course for the 2020 Batch “A” Stream 1 Corps Members. “Therefore, the corps members shall be posted to commence their primary assignments forthwith, while they shall be invited back to the Orientation Camps when the situation improves, just like it happened a few years ago when the nation was confronted by Ebola virus. “The Management wishes to state that no corps member or camp official has contracted the virus.”
